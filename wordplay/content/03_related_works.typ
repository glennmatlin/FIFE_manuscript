In this section we contextualize our paper with respect to other surveys of LMs in games:  agent architecture @hu_SurveyLargeLanguage_2025, modeling @gao_large_2024, simulation @ma_ComputationalExperimentsMeet_2024, and general game applications @xu_SurveyGamePlaying_2024.
There are also survey papers on strategic reasoning @zhang_LLMMastermindSurvey_2024, game theory @sun_GameTheoryMeets_2025, and benchmarking social reasoning and persuasion @yao_SPINbenchHowWell_2025 @park_AIDeceptionSurvey_2024 @feng_SurveyLargeLanguage_2025. 

These surveys focus on games with well-defined rules and clear win conditions. In contrast, our work focuses on the sub-domain of open-ended, language-based wargames characterized by their qualitative nature, ambiguous rules, and the importance of narrative and argumentation. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping literature review and comprehensive research agenda for the use of AI in this class of wargame.
