# Wargames Paper Work Plan

This file outlines the plan for addressing the comments and TODOs in the wargames paper. The tasks are divided into three phases, starting with quick wins and moving to more complex tasks.

---

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Low Effort, High-Value Cleanup)

These are simple changes that will quickly improve the consistency and polish of the paper.

1.  **Terminology Consistency:** In `content/01_introduction.typ`, there's a `RIEDL` comment about using "AI in wargames" instead of "AI wargames". I'll perform a global search and replace to ensure consistency.
2.  **Typst Linking:** In `content/04_methodology.typ`, a `TODO` asks to link to an appendix. I'll fix this using typst's linking functionality.
3.  **Clarify Related Works:** In `content/03_related_works.typ`, a `TODO` suggests explaining that "related work" means other literature reviews. I'll add a clarifying sentence.
4.  **Refine Definition:** In `content/02_background.typ`, a `TODO` suggests adding a bullet point to refine the definition of "serious games". I'll add the suggested bullet point.
5.  **Add Footnote:** In `content/01_introduction.typ`, a `RIEDL` comment suggests a footnote about Dungeons & Dragons. I'll add the footnote.

### Phase 2: High Impact / Medium Effort

After the quick wins, we can address these more substantial points that will significantly improve the paper's content.

*   **Add Citations:** Several comments in `content/02_background.typ` and `content/04_methodology.typ` ask for citations (e.g., for RAND, Jonathan Balloch's work, and survey review papers).
*   **Resolve Wording:** In `content/05_results.typ`, there's a "Choose one" comment. I will propose a resolution.
*   **Add Examples:** Comments in `content/05_results.typ` and `content/01_introduction.typ` ask for more examples.
*   **Expand on Future Work:** In `content/09_future_work.typ`, a comment suggests expanding on future work topics.

### Phase 3: High Impact / High Effort

These are the most involved tasks that will require more significant work but will have the largest impact on the paper.

*   **Rewrite for Clarity:** A paragraph in `content/05_results.typ` is marked as not understandable.
*   **Write New Sections:** A `TODO` in `content/02_background.typ` asks for a new section on the definition of AI used in the paper.
*   **Incorporate Text:** A `TODO` in `content/01_introduction.typ` asks to incorporate a large block of text from the abstract.
*   **Add Numerous Citations:** A `TODO` in `content/03_related_works.typ` lists a large number of papers to be cited.
*   **Add New Results:** A `TODO` in `content/05_results.typ` asks for new results to be added (e.g., time analysis).
*   **Research and Write:** A `TODO` in `content/06_discussion.typ` asks for research and writing on "Dark winter" and other wargames.
*   **Address Major Comments:** Several `RIEDL` comments in `content/07_safety.typ` and `content/05_results.typ` raise significant points that require careful consideration and likely rewriting of sections.
