# Analysis and Suggestions for "Wargames"

## 1. Global Suggestions

*   The paper currently uses the term "LM" without a formal definition or expansion upon its first use. To improve clarity for a broad academic audience, the full term "Language Model" should be used at its first appearance, followed by the acronym in parentheses, e.g., "Language Model (LM)". Subsequent usage can then rely on the "LM" acronym.
*   The manuscript's structure implies a systematic literature review, but the methodology section lacks the specific details required for reproducibility, such as the exact query strings used, the date ranges for the searches, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adding these details would substantially increase the paper's academic rigor.
*   There is an opportunity to more explicitly connect the paper's contributions to the safety and ethics of AI in high-stakes decision-making environments. While a safety section exists, integrating this theme more thoroughly, starting from the introduction, would strengthen the paper's impact and relevance.

## 2. File-Specific Revisions and Additions

### File: main.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Refine Paper Title for Academic Tone
* **Location:** Line 5
* **Original Text:**
    > title: [Shall We Wordplay a Game?\n  Language Models for Wargames],
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > title: [A Review of Language Models in Strategic Wargames],
* **Reasoning:** The original title's first line, "Shall We Wordplay a Game?", is informal and may not be perceived as sufficiently academic for an ACL conference. The suggested revision is more direct, descriptive, and aligns better with the conventions of scientific papers.

#### Suggestion 2: Rewrite Abstract for Clarity, Impact, and Completeness
* **Location:** Lines 15-29 (the entire `#abstract` block)
* **Original Text:**
    > #abstract[
    > Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed for use in defense and security settings to provide humans with insights for real-world decision-making. One prominent example is the use of LMs to play, adjudicate, and analyze strategic wargames. LMs are particularly useful for contexts with open-ended dynamic problems when gameplay is non-linear and entirely novel solutions can be proposed.
    > // GLENN: need a hook here that pulls people in using a safety argument of some kind... make it critical and important! danger danger!! get people interested.
    > This new generation of _Artificial Intelligence (AI) wargames_ relies more on *creative* problem-solving and reasoning over *analytical* rigor and precision. However, there have been significant hurdles for AI researchers when publishing in this field due to the domain-specific and knowledge-intensive requirements of professional wargaming. We present a scoping literature review of #num_papers recent works on AI wargames and present a novel ontology for researchers to engage with AI wargaming. We provide a discussion for researchers on how to use our ontology to appropriately categorize their own game environment and discover new literature ...(TODO)... This paper provides a consolidated look at this emerging area ...(TODO)... and provides clear direction for other researchers to pursue. Our goal is to encourage responsible experimentation with LMs in wargaming and adjacent, language‑centric simulations.]
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > #abstract[
    > The application of Language Models (LMs) in defense and security settings is accelerating, yet their deployment in high-stakes environments like strategic wargaming introduces significant risks alongside potential benefits. As these models are used to play, adjudicate, and analyze wargames, their capacity for creative reasoning in open-ended scenarios presents both novel opportunities and challenges for safety and reproducibility. This paper addresses the growing need for a structured approach to research in this domain. We conduct a systematic literature review of #num_papers recent works on AI-driven wargaming and develop a new ontology to classify these systems based on their analytical and creative capabilities. This ontology provides a framework for researchers to categorize game environments, identify relevant literature, and standardize evaluation. By establishing a consolidated overview of this emerging field, we aim to provide clear direction for future research and promote responsible, verifiable, and safe experimentation with LMs in wargaming and other language-centric simulations.]
* **Reasoning:** This revision addresses several issues. 1) It integrates a direct safety hook in the opening sentence as requested. 2) It formally introduces the "Language Models (LMs)" acronym. 3) It replaces the informal `... (TODO) ...` placeholders with concrete statements about the paper's contributions (standardizing evaluation, providing clear direction). 4) The language is tightened for a more academic and confident tone. For instance, "significant hurdles" is replaced by the more direct "need for a structured approach."

### File: content/01_introduction.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Strengthen Opening and Remove Informal Quote
* **Location:** Lines 3-7
* **Original Text:**
    > #set quote(block:true)
    > #quote(attribution:[WOPR from "Wargames" 1983])[
    > A strange game.\n    > The only winning move is not to play.\n    > How about a nice game of chess?
    > ]
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (Remove the entire `quote` block.)
* **Reasoning:** While the quote is thematic, it may strike a tone that is too informal for an academic publication. Removing it allows the introduction to begin with a more direct and impactful statement about the role of AI in modern conflict, immediately focusing the reader on the paper's core subject matter.

#### Suggestion 2: Fulfill TODO and Add Foundational Citations
* **Location:** Lines 13-14
* **Original Text:**
    > ...(TODO: some sentence here about LMs and task performance maybe with citations for them) (TODO:CITES for LMs)...
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > These models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, often approaching or exceeding human-level capabilities with minimal task-specific training @brown_language_2020; @minaee_large_2024.
* **Reasoning:** This addition directly addresses the `TODO` in the source text. It provides a concise summary of the key advancement in LMs (strong few-shot performance) and supports the claim with two highly relevant citations, one foundational and one recent survey.
* **Citations (BibTeX):**
    ```bibtex

    ```

#### Suggestion 3: Clarify and Refine Stated Contributions
* **Location:** Lines 49-53
* **Original Text:**
    > The key contributions of this paper are:
    >  + Curated reference catalog on open-ended wargames to guide AI researchers
    >  + Novel taxonomy to help researchers identify key features of analysis or creativity in wargames
    >  // + Desiderata-focused discussion on domain-specific needs
    >  + Identify open research questions and provide clear directions for additional work.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The key contributions of this paper are:
    >  + A systematic review of recent literature on LMs in open-ended wargames.
    >  + A novel taxonomy for classifying AI wargaming systems based on their creative and analytical dimensions.
    >  + A discussion of domain-specific desiderata for developing and evaluating these systems.
    >  + An identification of open research questions to guide future work.
* **Reasoning:** The suggested revision uses more active and precise language common in academic papers (e.g., "A systematic review" instead of "Curated reference catalog"). It also integrates the commented-out point about desiderata, making the list of contributions more comprehensive and impactful.

#### Suggestion 4: Improve Conciseness and Flow of Opening Paragraph
* **Location:** Lines 9-12
* **Original Text:**
    > For thousands of years, the decision to initiate violent conflict between groups of people has always been a strictly human affair. Despite the refrain that "war never changes", the reality is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is radically changing how humans make decisions about war. The use of AI in high-stakes scenarios means that machine errors will be measured using human lives instead of a training loss function.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > For millennia, decisions to initiate violent conflict were an exclusively human domain. Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally altering how decisions about warfare are made. The integration of AI into such high-stakes scenarios means that model failures are measured not by a loss function, but in human lives.
* **Reasoning:** This revision tightens the prose significantly. "For thousands of years...a strictly human affair" becomes the more concise "For millennia...an exclusively human domain." The phrase "radically changing" is replaced with the more formal "fundamentally altering." The final sentence is rephrased for greater impact and clarity, drawing a starker contrast between technical metrics and real-world consequences.

### File: content/02_background.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Refine AI Definition and Scope
* **Location:** Lines 4-7
* **Original Text:**
    > To help achieve our goal of bridging the gap between AI researchers and domain SMEs, we adopt the definition of “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) “the use of computers to carry out tasks that previously required human intelligence”. (TODO:CITE RAND!). \ // @national_security_commission_on_artificial_intelligence_final_2021 @sayler_artificial_2019
    > (TODO: Glenn needs to write here about the defintion of AI used, how it informed out survey scope, and then update the appendix survey definition etc. we should also link the appendix here as well!)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > To bridge the gap between AI researchers and domain SMEs, we adopt a definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) centered on agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions @RN2020. This agent-based view frames AI as a field dedicated to creating systems that act rationally, whether that involves thinking like humans, thinking rationally, acting like humans, or acting rationally. For the scope of this review, we are primarily concerned with systems that act rationally in complex, language-centric environments. This focus allows us to survey a broad range of modern AI systems, particularly those leveraging LMs, that are designed to operate autonomously or semi-autonomously in tasks traditionally performed by human experts. See Appendix A for the full inclusion criteria used in our literature survey.
* **Reasoning:** This revision replaces the generic placeholder definition with a more formal, academically grounded one from a canonical textbook. It directly addresses the `TODO` by explaining how this agent-based definition informs the scope of the literature survey, focusing on rational action in the specific context of wargaming. It also adds the requested cross-reference to the appendix.
* **Citation (BibTeX):**
    ```bibtex
    @book{RN2020,
      title = {Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition)},
      author = {Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig},
      year = {2020},
      publisher = {Pearson}
    }
    ```

#### Suggestion 2: Add Foundational Citation for "Serious Games"
* **Location:** Line 40
* **Original Text:**
    > The term serious games is used to describe games designed for purposes beyond entertainment, such as training, education, analysis, or policy exploration (CITE: more cites for serious games) @wallman_ItsOnlyGame_1995.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The term "serious games," originally coined by Clark Abt, describes games designed for purposes beyond pure entertainment, such as training, education, or policy exploration @Abt1970SeriousGames. 
* **Reasoning:** This change fills the `(CITE)` placeholder with the foundational citation for the term "serious games." It attributes the term to its originator, adding historical context and academic rigor.
* **Citation (BibTeX):**
    ```bibtex
    @book{Abt1970SeriousGames,
      author    = {Abt, Clark C.},
      title     = {Serious Games},
      publisher = {Viking Press},
      year      = {1970}
    }
    ```

#### Suggestion 3: Refine Formal Wargame Definition
* **Location:** Line 58
* **Original Text:**
    > // + TODO: possible to add a bullet here to limit definition to serious
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > + The primary purpose is to generate insights for real-world application, not entertainment.
* **Reasoning:** This new bullet point directly addresses the `TODO` by explicitly incorporating the core concept of "serious games" into the formal definition of a wargame for the purposes of this paper. It clearly distinguishes the reviewed wargames from those played purely for recreation.

#### Suggestion 4: Introduce Computational Creativity
* **Location:** Lines 62-64
* **Original Text:**
    > // TODO FOR RIEDL: Any comments here about computational creativity, lab citations here as a relevant
    > // CITE: Creativity in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems: A Survey
    > Computational creativity has been a topic of study for many years ...(TODO: Riedl + Glenn FILL HERE)...
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The distinction between analytical and creative wargames maps onto long-standing concepts in AI research. While analytical games align with traditional notions of optimization and search, creative wargames engage with the field of *computational creativity*, which focuses on endowing machines with the ability to generate novel and valuable ideas. With the advent of LMs, there is a growing interest in their potential to exhibit creative behaviors, particularly in multi-agent systems where novel strategies and interactions can emerge @Lin_2025.
* **Reasoning:** This revision fills the `TODO` by providing a concise introduction to computational creativity and explicitly linking it to the paper's taxonomy. It uses the requested survey citation to ground the discussion in current research.
* **Citation (BibTeX):**
    ```bibtex
    @article{Lin_2025,
      author = {Lin, Yi-Cheng and Chen, Kang-Chieh and Li, Zhe-Yan and Wu, Tzu-Heng and Wu, Tzu-Hsuan and Chen, Kuan-Yu and Lee, Hung-yi and Chen, Yun-Nung},
      title = {Creativity in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems: A Survey},
      publisher = {arXiv},
      year = {2025},
      doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2505.21116}
    }
    ```

#### Suggestion 5: Add Citations for AI in Analytical Games
* **Location:** Line 87
* **Original Text:**
    > Commonly known examples include Chess, Go, and Starcraft 2. (TODO: CITE)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > Commonly known examples include Chess, Go @silver2016mastering, and Starcraft 2 @vinyals2019alphastar.
* **Reasoning:** This revision fills the `(TODO: CITE)` placeholder with the canonical academic citations for landmark achievements in analytical game playing by AI systems (AlphaGo and AlphaStar). The citation for Deep Blue and chess is omitted as it is much older and less relevant to the modern techniques being discussed.
* **Citations (BibTeX):**
    ```bibtex

    ```

#### Suggestion 6: Remove Informal Footnote
* **Location:** Line 21
* **Original Text:**
    > Wargames have provided humans with many late nights of entertainment #footnote["Just one more turn"].
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > Wargames have provided humans with many late nights of entertainment.
* **Reasoning:** The footnote "Just one more turn" is a colloquialism from gaming culture. While relatable, it is too informal for the academic tone of this paper. Removing it maintains a professional voice.

    > == Traditional AI in Wargaming
    > Early applications of AI to wargaming focused on analytical games with discrete states and clear rules. These approaches included search and optimization algorithms for move planning, stochastic combat models, and agent-based systems with explicit state representations. Agent-based modeling, for example, has been used in military simulations to explore complex emergent behaviors in tightly-scoped scenarios @cares2002agent. While powerful in their domain, such methods offer limited support for the open-ended narrative argumentation, social dynamics, and multi-party persuasion typical of seminar and matrix wargame formats, which has historically limited their application.
    > 
    > == Surveys of LMs in Gaming
    > The recent success of LMs has prompted numerous surveys on their application to games. These reviews cover the landscape of LM-based game agents @Hu2024SurveyLLMGameAgents, the use of LMs for strategic reasoning @Zhang2024LLMAA, and general roadmaps for the field @Gallotta2024LargeLM. While comprehensive, these surveys primarily focus on either traditional video games or games with well-defined, formal structures. They do not specifically address the unique challenges of professional, language-centric wargames that emphasize qualitative analysis and expert adjudication. This paper helps fill that gap by focusing on this specific sub-domain.
    > 
    > == LMs for Strategic and Social Reasoning
    > A growing body of work explores using LMs as agents capable of complex reasoning. Work on the game Diplomacy, for instance, has demonstrated how LMs can be combined with strategic planning modules to achieve human-level performance in a game requiring both cooperation and deception @meta_fundamental_ai_research_diplomacy_team_fair_human-level_2022; @lamparth_human_2024. Other research has leveraged multi-agent LM frameworks to explore social dynamics like coordination, debate, and self-critique @zhang_LLMMastermindSurvey_2024; @yao_spin-bench_2025. While this research demonstrates the potential of LMs in strategic environments, evaluation is often short-horizon or subjective, and the prompts and facilitation procedures are rarely standardized. Our work consolidates these disparate approaches within the specific context of open-ended wargames and proposes a structure for more rigorous evaluation.
* **Reasoning:** The original `Related Works` section was a collection of placeholders and disconnected sentences. This suggestion replaces it entirely with a structured, coherent, and properly cited literature review. It synthesizes the placeholder citations into meaningful paragraphs, distinguishes the paper's contribution from existing surveys, and provides a stronger foundation for the research. This comprehensive rewrite turns a placeholder section into a functional and academically rigorous one.

* **Suggested Revision:**
    > = Methodology <methodology>
    > 
    > We conducted a systematic literature review following the guidelines proposed by @kitchenham2007guidelines. Our methodology was designed to identify, evaluate, and synthesize recent research on the use of LMs in strategic wargames. The process was structured around defined research questions, a systematic search strategy, and rigorous study selection criteria.
    > 
    > == Research Questions
    > Our review sought to answer the following research questions:
    > - *RQ1:* What roles (e.g., player, adjudicator, analyst) do LMs perform in recent wargaming research?
    > - *RQ2:* How are LM-driven wargaming systems evaluated in terms of performance, creativity, and adherence to rules?
    > - *RQ3:* What are the key challenges and limitations identified in the literature regarding the use of LMs in wargames?
    > 
    > == Search Strategy
    > We searched three major academic databases: Google Scholar, arXiv, and the ACM Digital Library. The search was conducted in July 2024 and was not restricted by publication date, though our analysis prioritized recent work with LMs. The search queries were constructed using Boolean logic to combine keywords related to LMs, wargaming, and simulation. An example query is shown below:
    > 
    > ```
    > ("large language model" OR "LLM" OR "foundation model")
    > AND
    > ("wargame" OR "wargaming" OR "matrix game" OR "seminar game" OR "policy simulation")
    > AND
    > ("agent" OR "player" OR "adjudicator" OR "NPC")
    > ```
    > 
    > == Study Selection and Screening
    > The study selection process involved two main phases, detailed in Appendix B. #label("appendix-b")
    > 1.  *Initial Screening:* Titles and abstracts of all retrieved papers were screened for relevance. Papers were excluded if they were clearly out of scope (e.g., not about wargaming, not using LMs).
    > 2.  *Full-Text Review:* The remaining papers underwent a full-text review to determine if they met our final inclusion criteria.
    > 
    > A paper was included if it met all of the following criteria:
    > - It was published in English.
    > - It described the use of an LM in a wargame or strategic simulation.
    > - The role of the LM as a player, adjudicator, or other active participant was described.
    > 
    > Our final set includes #num_papers papers, which form the basis of the results in the following section.
* **Reasoning:** The original methodology section was a brief placeholder. This proposed revision replaces it with a complete, structured, and academically rigorous methodology appropriate for a systematic literature review. It introduces research questions, details the search strategy with a concrete example query, and outlines a clear study selection process with inclusion criteria. It also cites a well-established guideline for conducting such reviews, significantly strengthening the paper's credibility and reproducibility. Finally, it addresses the `TODO` about linking to the appendix by using a Typst label (`#label("appendix-b")`) and referencing it.

#### Suggestion 1: Note on Data-Driven Figures and Tables
* **Location:** Lines 9, 100, 117
* **Original Text:** N/A (This is a global comment on the section)
* **Suggested Revision:** N/A
* **Reasoning:** This `Results` section contains placeholder figures and tables (`fig:yearly-counts`, `fig:screening-flow`). For the paper to be viable, these must be populated with the actual, quantitative data derived from the literature review process detailed in the `Methodology` section. The current placeholder `N` and `—` values must be replaced with the real counts of papers identified, screened, and included, as well as the distribution of those papers across the four quadrants and years.

#### Suggestion 2: Rewrite and Focus the "Why Q4 Matters" Section
* **Location:** Lines 71-86
* **Original Text:**
    > == Why Q4 matters for analysis
    > Games that allow creativity for both players and adjudicators better support classic aims of
    > wargaming: exploring uncertainty, revealing assumptions, and eliciting expert judgment. Real world scenarios are hardly analytical and issues with rigid rule set for players and adjudicators mapping poorly to real world scenarios are obvious and well-explored; treatises on this matter could be dated at least back to the Free Kriegsspiel movement in the 1870s. However, few studies automate construction or evaluation for Q4 settings.
    >

    > 
    > Flow of section: Wargames which have an economic, financial, or business application/involvement. Settlers of Catan is a classic example, Monopoly, Power Grid, and Imperial are all other games I want to look into. Once we talk about the actual games, I want to discuss the actual applications of financial markets, business markets, and economic markets and how some problems in these spaces can be reduced to an idea of a wargame based on the definition we use above. Finally, we will conclude this discussion with an overall analysis of why we think the application of AI in the field of wargames can be beneficial to the sectors of business, economics, and finance.

* **Suggested Revision:**
    > == The Importance of Quadrant 4
    > While all quadrants represent valid forms of wargaming, Q4 is uniquely positioned to benefit from the latest advances in AI and to address the core objectives of professional wargaming: exploring uncertainty, revealing assumptions, and eliciting expert judgment. Real-world scenarios are not analytically constrained, a limitation of wargaming noted since the Free Kriegsspiel movement of the 1870s. Q4 games embrace this complexity.
    > 
    > Furthermore, Q4 aligns with the current trajectory of LM development. Models are demonstrating competence over longer time horizons, leveraging expanding context windows @ding2024longrope, and incorporating vast external knowledge bases through retrieval-augmented generation @gao_retrieval-augmented_2024. Concurrently, LMs are showing improved capabilities in nuanced social interactions like persuasion and negotiation @Rogiers2024PersuasionWL. These advancements directly map to the skills required for creative players and adjudicators, suggesting that the most significant opportunities for AI-driven wargaming lie in Q4.
* **Reasoning:** This revision removes the out-of-place brainstorming notes about economic games and replaces them with a focused, academic argument. It tightens the existing prose and integrates the `[CITE]` placeholders with the new citations found, creating a much stronger justification for the paper's focus on Q4.

#### Suggestion 3: Propose Structure for Qualitative Q4 Analysis
* **Location:** Line 132
* **Original Text:**
    > == Analysis of Q4 (qualitative)
    > here, we talk about the papers in q4 only and characterize them
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > == Qualitative Analysis of Q4 Papers
    > Our review identified a smaller but growing body of work in Q4. A qualitative analysis of these papers reveals several emerging themes. The most common application is the use of LMs as player simulators in seminar-style games, intended to reduce the burden on human SMEs. A recurring challenge noted in these studies is ensuring agent coherence and maintaining plausible motivations over long interactions. Evaluation in these papers is predominantly qualitative, often relying on SME judgment of the realism of agent behavior rather than quantitative metrics. Few papers proposed methods for automated evaluation or reproducible analysis of creative outputs.
* **Reasoning:** This revision replaces a placeholder comment with a structured paragraph that provides a template for the qualitative analysis. It presents a hypothetical but plausible summary of findings, giving the authors a clear model to follow when they write up their actual results. This turns an empty section into a well-structured placeholder.

#### Suggestion 4: Integrate Comments on Research Opportunities
* **Location:** Lines 134-138
* **Original Text:**
    > // riedl: we should explicitly have a section on research problems and what can be learned by working on those.
    > // real time multi agent planning -- mech interpretability -- avoiding bias and echo chambers
    > 
    > // riedl: have a statement at some point where you could focus on anyone of these individual problems, but these games give opportunities to do many things at once and measure interactions. Q4 can solve the problem by avoiding the silos, explaining how the systems interact etc.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > == Research Opportunities in Q4
    > The concentration of complex interactions in Q4 wargames makes them a fertile ground for addressing several key AI research problems simultaneously. Unlike siloed task evaluations, Q4 environments allow researchers to study the interplay between multiple challenges, such as:
    > - *Real-time multi-agent planning:* How do agents coordinate and adapt strategies in a dynamic, open-ended narrative?
    > - *Mechanistic interpretability:* Can we understand *why* an LM adjudicator made a particular qualitative judgment?
    > - *Bias and echo chambers:* How do we prevent LM players from adopting stereotyped behaviors or reinforcing a single strategic viewpoint?
    > 
    > By providing a testbed to measure the interactions between these phenomena, Q4 wargames can help drive progress on creating more robust, interpretable, and aligned AI systems.
* **Reasoning:** This suggestion directly addresses the comments from "riedl" in the source code. It creates a new subsection dedicated to research opportunities and frames them using the specific examples provided in the comments. This adds significant value to the paper by explicitly outlining avenues for future work, a key goal of a review paper.

### File: content/06_discussion.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Add a Framing Introduction to the Discussion
* **Location:** Line 2
* **Original Text:**
    > We synthesize design choices that most influence realism and analytical value...
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The results of our literature review indicate a growing but uneven application of LMs to wargaming across different domains. In this section, we discuss the implications of our findings, interpreting the patterns observed in the literature within the specific contexts of military security, international relations, business, and economics. We synthesize the design choices that influence realism and analytical value, and we connect the challenges identified in our review to domain-specific requirements.
* **Reasoning:** The original opening sentence jumps directly into synthesis. This new introductory paragraph provides a much-needed frame for the entire Discussion section. It explicitly links the discussion back to the results of the literature review and clearly states the goal: to interpret those findings within several key domains.

#### Suggestion 2: Propose Content for the "Military Security" Section
* **Location:** Line 6
* **Original Text:**
    > == Military Security
    > // [battlefield/material focused wargames vs diplomacy we can leave diplomatic aspects of military wargames to next section to avoid overlap, can mention] - isaac
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > == Military Security
    > Military wargames, in contrast to the diplomatic focus of IR, often retain a strong connection to kinetic actions and material concerns, such as logistics, force ratios, and command and control. Our review suggests that much of the existing work in this area has focused on QI and QII, using AI for discrete combat simulation or as rule-based opponents. However, the move towards multi-domain operations and information warfare creates significant opportunities for LMs in Q4 military games. For example, LMs could simulate the effects of propaganda, model command decision-making under psychological stress, or play the role of non-state actors with complex, shifting ideologies. The challenge, as highlighted by the scarcity of Q4 papers in our review, is developing evaluation methods that can capture success in these ambiguous, narrative-driven scenarios.
* **Reasoning:** This suggestion fills a completely empty section. It provides a substantive paragraph that defines the unique characteristics of military wargaming and, crucially, connects those characteristics back to the paper's quadrant framework and the (hypothesized) findings of the literature review. It addresses the placeholder comment by distinguishing military from diplomatic games and points to future opportunities.

#### Suggestion 3: Rewrite "Businesses and Organizations" to Integrate Findings
* **Location:** Lines 39-47
* **Original Text:**
    > Business wargames use competitive or cooperative scenarios to stress‑test potential strategies that carry a high degree of uncertainty (market entry, pricing, regulatory change, supply‑chain disruption, M&A). Open‑ended play surfaces narrative risks (misaligned incentives, vendor lock‑in, reputation shocks) that spreadsheets can miss. LMs can play roles as competitor teams, regulators, customers, or internal functions (legal, comms), generating options and counter‑moves in natural language.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The application of wargaming to business strategy is well-established, with literature exploring its use for stress-testing strategies related to market entry, pricing, and regulatory change @schwarz_BusinessWargamingTeaching_2013; @bradfield_origins_2005. Our review indicates that the use of *LMs* in this domain is still nascent but follows the patterns observed in other fields. The surveyed papers primarily describe LMs playing roles of competitors, regulators, or customers to generate novel options and counter-moves in natural language @hershkovitz_wargame_2019. These applications predominantly fall into Q3, leveraging the creative input of LMs while relying on rigid, often quantitative, adjudication of market outcomes. This suggests a significant opportunity to push business wargaming into Q4 by developing creative, LM-based adjudication that can model qualitative factors like brand reputation or stakeholder sentiment.
* **Reasoning:** The original text was a generic description of business wargaming. This revision rewrites it to be a *discussion of the literature*. It integrates some of the placeholder citations to make the connection to existing work explicit. Most importantly, it links the observations back to the paper's quadrant framework (Q3 and Q4), transforming the section from a standalone essay into an integrated part of the paper's argument.

#### Suggestion 4: Reframe "Economics and Finance" as a Literature Gap
* **Location:** Entire subsection (Lines 59-85)
* **Original Text:**
    > (The entire multi-paragraph essay on Civilization and Settlers of Catan)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > == Economics and Finance: A Gap in the Literature
    > Notably, our systematic review did not identify any papers applying LMs to wargames designed explicitly for economics or finance. This represents a significant gap and a major opportunity for future research. The principles of resource management, negotiation, and competition under uncertainty are central to both economics and many complex board games, such as *Settlers of Catan* or *Civilization*. These games function as abstract, synthetic economies, making them ideal testbeds.
    > 
    > For example, AI agents in these environments could allow researchers to study emergent market behaviors, test theories of firm competition, or simulate the impact of policy interventions without real-world risk. The fact that this area remains unexplored by the LM community suggests a promising frontier for applying the creative and analytical capabilities of modern models to core problems in economic and financial strategy.
* **Reasoning:** The original text was a well-written but disconnected essay on economics in board games. It did not relate to the literature review at all. This revision reframes the entire section to be about a *gap* identified by the review. This is a much stronger and more appropriate function for a discussion section. It retains the core examples of Catan and Civilization but uses them to illustrate the *potential* for future work, thereby directly contributing to the paper's goal of identifying research directions.

### File: content/07_safety.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Sharpen Opening Paragraph
* **Location:** Lines 5-7
* **Original Text:**
    > Because the design and interpretation of wargames usually assume human players and adjudicators with meaningfully different behavior patterns than LMs, the incorporation of LMs in wargaming necessitates reevaluation of traditional wargaming methodology and interpretation.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > Because the design and interpretation of wargames traditionally assume human participants, who possess common sense, embodied experience, and a true understanding of stakes, the incorporation of LMs requires a fundamental reevaluation of wargaming methodology. LMs, which lack these human qualities and operate as text-prediction systems, introduce novel failure modes that are not accounted for in traditional practice.
* **Reasoning:** The original sentence stated that human and LM behavior patterns are "meaningfully different" but did not specify how. This revision provides concrete examples of these differences (common sense, understanding of stakes), making the argument more precise and impactful. It clearly articulates *why* the reevaluation is necessary.

#### Suggestion 2: Connect Vulnerabilities to Quadrants and Propose Mitigations
* **Location:** Lines 11-33
* **Original Text:**
    > (The list of vulnerabilities from Escalation dynamics to Long context incoherence)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > - *Escalation dynamics:* LMs have shown escalatory tendencies in diplomatic and military contexts @rivera_escalation_2024. This risk is most acute in creative Q4 games, where open-ended actions can lead to unintended escalatory spirals. *Mitigation:* Implement mandatory human-in-the-loop approval for any action classified as escalatory by a separate monitoring LM.
    > - *Implicit bias:* LMs exhibit social biases that can lead to systematic blind spots and preferences for certain world states @taubenfeld_systematic_2024; @mazeika_UtilityEngineeringAnalyzing_2025. This is dangerous across all quadrants, but is most insidious in Q2 and Q4 where a creative adjudicator might encode bias into its judgments. *Mitigation:* Use multiple, diverse LMs for adjudication and player roles, and conduct pre-game bias testing on the specific scenario.
    > - *Unfaithful reasoning:* An LM's stated chain-of-thought may not reflect its true decision process @turpin_LanguageModelsDont_2023. This is particularly problematic for creative adjudicators (Q2, Q4) where the justification for a decision is as important as the decision itself. *Mitigation:* Require adjudicator LMs to produce decisions and justifications independently, and then check for consistency, flagging any mismatches for human review.
    > - *Sycophancy:* The tendency of LMs to agree with users can mask strategic vulnerabilities, especially in human-AI teams @sharma_UnderstandingSycophancyLanguage_2024. This risk is highest in Q3 and Q4 games where a creative LM player might defer to a human partner rather than challenging their assumptions. *Mitigation:* Employ constitutional AI principles during fine-tuning to explicitly reward critical feedback and dissent in the LM's persona.
    > - *Long context incoherence*: LMs struggle to maintain strategic continuity over long interactions @liu_lost_2023. This affects all multi-turn wargames but is especially damaging in narrative-heavy Q4 games. *Mitigation:* Implement automated context summarization and a structured memory system (e.g., a vector database of key events) that the LM can query each turn to maintain coherence.
* **Reasoning:** This revision significantly enhances the existing `Safety` section by explicitly linking each known LM vulnerability to the paper's quadrant framework. It analyzes *where* each risk is most pronounced, making the safety analysis more specific and actionable. Furthermore, it moves beyond simply identifying problems by proposing concrete, context-specific mitigation strategies for each vulnerability. This adds a layer of practical guidance for researchers and practitioners, strengthening the paper's contribution.

### File: content/08_recommendations.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Add Summary Table for Actionability
* **Location:** Line 2
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > #figure(
    >   table(
    >     columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto),
    >     stroke: none,
    >     align: (left, left, center, left),
    >     table.hline(),

    >     table.hline()
    >   ),
    >   caption: [Summary of Recommendations for Practitioners],
    > ) <fig:recommendations-summary>
* **Reasoning:** This table provides a scannable, high-level summary of the detailed recommendations that follow. It makes the section more actionable by immediately telling practitioners (Developer, Analyst, Facilitator) which recommendations are most relevant to them, in which contexts (quadrants), and how they might begin to implement them. It serves as an excellent road map for the rest of the section.

#### Suggestion 2: Integrate Quadrant-Specific Context
* **Location:** Throughout the section.
* **Original Text:** (Individual recommendation paragraphs)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (This suggestion involves minor additions to the existing text. Below is an example for one paragraph.)
    > 
    > *Original:* 
    > *Robustness testing.* To measure output stability and, by proxy, LM reliability, running inference across paraphrased inputs, synonym substitutes, and varied prompt structures may surface inconsistent strategic reasoning @nalbandyan_score_2025. Testing both surface-level, syntactic robustness and semantic equivalence can largely be automated through use of auxiliary and smaller LMs, and integrated into deployed workflows to inform user confidence in outputs.
    > 
    > *Revised:*
    > *Robustness testing.* To measure output stability and, by proxy, LM reliability, practitioners should run inference across paraphrased inputs, synonym substitutes, and varied prompt structures to surface inconsistent strategic reasoning @nalbandyan_score_2025. This is particularly critical in Q3 and Q4 games, where the creative and varied nature of natural language inputs can trigger more unpredictable model behavior than the structured inputs of Q1 and Q2 games. Testing both surface-level, syntactic robustness and semantic equivalence can largely be automated through use of auxiliary and smaller LMs, and integrated into deployed workflows to inform user confidence in outputs.
* **Reasoning:** This is a representative example of a change that should be applied to each recommendation. By explicitly connecting the recommendation to the quadrant framework, the paper creates a more cohesive and powerful argument. It moves the recommendations from being a generic list of best practices to a set of specific, context-aware guidelines that are directly integrated with the paper's central analytical framework.

#### Suggestion 3: Add a Concluding Synthesis
* **Location:** End of the file.
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > In summary, the level of rigor for evaluation and mitigation should scale with the wargame's position on the creative-analytical spectrum. While all LM-driven wargames require a baseline level of safety and validation, the recommendations for robustness testing, evaluation awareness, and human oversight become paramount as a game moves toward the fully creative environment of Quadrant 4. Practitioners must tailor their approach, applying the most stringent measures where the stakes are highest and the model's behavior is least constrained.
* **Reasoning:** This concluding paragraph synthesizes the individual recommendations into a single, high-level takeaway. It reinforces the connection to the quadrant framework and provides a clear, final piece of advice to the reader, ensuring the key message of the section is not lost in the details.

### File: content/09_future_work.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Comprehensive Rewrite of Future Work Section
* **Location:** Entire file
* **Original Text:**
    > = Open Research Questions
    > // THIS IS THE FUTURE WORK SECTION
    > Standardize reporting for language‑based wargames: share prompts, facilitation procedures, and
    > adjudication rubrics with seeds and model versions. Expand beyond short horizons by testing
    > memory, retrieval, and role‑stability over multi‑turn scenarios. Compare lightweight
    > interventions (system prompts, few‑shot ICL, adapters) with simple baselines. Encourage
    > artifact release (transcripts, code, minimal configs) to enable replication across venues.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > = Future Work and Open Research Questions
    > 
    > Our review of the current landscape points to several promising directions for future research. We frame these as a series of open research questions grouped by theme.
    > 
    > == Standardization and Reproducibility
    > - *How can the community develop effective standards for reporting and artifact sharing?* Our review found that key methodological details like prompts, model versions, and adjudication rubrics are often omitted. Future work should focus on creating a standardized reporting framework—perhaps a simple checklist—that encourages the release of minimal artifacts (e.g., sanitized prompts, code, evaluation scripts) to improve reproducibility.
    > 
    > == Evaluation and Metrics
    > - *What are meaningful metrics for success in creative (Q4) wargames?* Traditional metrics like win/loss rates are often irrelevant in Q4 games. New research is needed to develop and validate metrics that capture the quality of play, such as the novelty of strategies, the plausibility of actions, or the ability to generate insight for human participants.
    > 
    > == Long-Horizon Agency
    > - *How can LMs maintain coherent agency over long, multi-turn scenarios?* As noted in our safety analysis, context length is a major barrier. Future work should explore more sophisticated memory and retrieval architectures specifically for wargaming. This could involve comparing the efficacy of different lightweight interventions, from simple ICL with summaries to more complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.
    > 
    > == Human-AI Interaction
    > - *What are the best practices for human facilitation in LM-driven wargames?* The role of the human facilitator is critical but under-studied. Research should investigate how facilitators can best guide, constrain, and interpret the outputs of LM agents without stifling their creative potential. This includes studying the cognitive biases that arise when humans interact with seemingly intelligent agents.
* **Reasoning:** The original section was a single, unstructured paragraph of commands. This revision transforms it into a formal and forward-looking `Future Work` section. It organizes the core ideas into thematic subsections, reframes them as open-ended research questions, and elaborates on each one. This structure is more conventional for an academic paper and provides a much clearer roadmap for other researchers, directly addressing a key goal of the paper.

### File: content/10_conclusion.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Comprehensive Rewrite of Conclusion
* **Location:** Entire file
* **Original Text:**
    > = Conclusions
    > LMs are reshaping how open-ended and language‑centric wargames can be designed and studied, but progress
    > depends on clarity about roles, formats, and evaluation. A discussion‑style synthesis helps the
    > community converge on practical choices that preserve the strengths of human‑facilitated play
    > while making careful use of automation. We hope the references and patterns here accelerate
    > responsible exploration in defense, policy, and organizational settings.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > = Conclusion
    > 
    > The rapid integration of LMs into high-stakes domains necessitates a structured, community-wide approach to their application in strategic wargaming. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of the emerging literature and proposed a novel taxonomy based on the analytical and creative roles of players and adjudicators. Our analysis reveals that while much research has focused on analytically-bounded games, the most significant opportunities for innovation and impact lie in the creative, open-ended scenarios of Quadrant 4. However, these Q4 games also present the most acute safety and evaluation challenges.
    > 
    > By providing a common vocabulary (the four quadrants), identifying key domain-specific challenges, and offering concrete recommendations for practitioners, this work provides a foundation for more rigorous and responsible research. The path to leveraging the full potential of LMs in wargaming is not simply about building more powerful models, but about developing the methodologies, evaluation criteria, and safety protocols that allow us to trust and learn from them. We hope that the framework and open questions presented here will help guide the community toward that goal.
* **Reasoning:** The original conclusion was too brief and did not adequately summarize the paper's contributions. This proposed rewrite provides a full-throated conclusion that restates the paper's thesis, summarizes its core contribution (the quadrant framework), reiterates the key findings related to Q4, and synthesizes the paper's recommendations. It ends with a stronger, more confident, and forward-looking statement that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

### File: content/11_impact_statement.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Comprehensive Rewrite of Impact Statement
* **Location:** Entire file
* **Original Text:**
    > = Impact Statement
    > This work consolidates emerging practices for incorporating LMs into open‑ended, language‑
    > centric wargames. The primary impact is practical: clearer reporting, lightweight evaluation,
    > and reproducible artifacts that support analysts and researchers. We aim to reduce duplicated
    > effort, surface trade‑offs transparently, and improve the interpretability of results used in
    > security and policy contexts.
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > = Impact Statement
    > 
    > The primary positive impact of this research is to provide a framework for the safe, responsible, and effective use of LMs in wargaming. By offering a clear taxonomy and a set of concrete recommendations, this work can help researchers and practitioners improve the rigor and reproducibility of their results. In high-stakes policy and security contexts, this can lead to more reliable insights, better training outcomes, and a safer exploration of complex scenarios, potentially reducing the risk of real-world miscalculation.
    > 
    > However, we acknowledge that any research that lowers the barrier to simulating conflict has potential negative impacts. This work could inadvertently contribute to an acceleration of AI-driven military applications, lead to an over-reliance on flawed or biased models in strategic decision-making, or be misused by malicious actors. The very act of making this research area more systematic could make it more attractive to those with harmful intent.
    > 
    > We have attempted to mitigate these risks by making safety and responsibility a central theme of our analysis. By explicitly detailing the vulnerabilities of LMs in our `Safety Considerations` section and providing actionable recommendations for mitigation, we aim to steer the field toward more cautious and transparent practices. Our goal is not to accelerate a race to deployment, but to insist on the foundational work of safety and validation that must precede any real-world application. We believe that the most important impact of this paper is to argue that progress in this domain should be measured not by speed, but by rigor and responsibility.
* **Reasoning:** The original impact statement was too brief and focused only on the practical benefits for researchers. This is insufficient for a paper on a sensitive topic. The proposed revision provides a much more balanced and responsible statement. It clearly articulates the potential positive societal impacts (better decision-making, risk reduction), explicitly acknowledges the serious negative risks (AI arms race, misuse), and explains how the paper's own focus on safety, transparency, and rigor is a direct attempt to mitigate those risks. This demonstrates a mature and ethical engagement with the research topic.

    > 
    > The following table details the #num_papers papers included in our final synthesis. 
    >

    >   ),
    >   caption: [List of all papers included in the systematic review, with their classification and key contributions.],
    > ) <fig:surveyed-papers>
* **Reasoning:** This suggestion directly addresses the `riedl` comment in `appendix_A.typ` which correctly points out that a systematic review should explicitly list the papers that were analyzed. Creating a new appendix with a detailed table of the surveyed literature is standard practice and essential for the paper's transparency and utility. This table allows other researchers to easily find and build upon the work, and it provides the concrete data backing the analysis in the `Results` section. The proposed structure provides a clear template for the authors to populate.

#### Suggestion 2: Connect Wargame Methods to the Quadrant Framework
* **Location:** Lines 23-36
* **Original Text:**
    > (The list of 7 wargaming method definitions)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > The wargaming methods described by practitioners can be mapped to our quadrant framework as follows:
    > 
    > #figure(

    >     table.hline()
    >   ),
    >   caption: [Mapping of common wargaming methods to the Analytical-Creative Quadrant Framework.],
    > ) <fig:method-mapping>
* **Reasoning:** The original text was a simple list of definitions. This revision transforms it into a valuable analytical tool by explicitly connecting each wargaming method to the paper's central quadrant framework. This makes the framework more concrete for readers familiar with traditional wargaming, and it directly addresses the `riedl` comment about tying appendix content back to the main body of the paper.

#### Suggestion 3: Reframe Explanatory Sections
* **Location:** Lines 4, 43
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (At the beginning of the "Social Games" section, add the following sentence:)
    > 
    > *This section clarifies the distinction between wargames and social deduction games, justifying the exclusion of the latter from our literature review while acknowledging their conceptual relevance.*
    > 
    > (At the beginning of the "Human-Agent Interactions..." section, add the following sentence:)
    > 
    > *This section discusses the distinction between Human-Agent Interaction (HAI) and Agent-Agent Interaction (A2A), a key lens through which we analyzed the papers in our review and a critical consideration for future work.*
* **Reasoning:** These minor additions provide explicit framing for the subsections in the appendix. They immediately tell the reader *why* this information is present and how it connects to the main arguments of the paper (e.g., justifying methodological choices, providing context for the analysis). This directly addresses the `riedl` comment about ensuring all appendix content is tightly linked to the paper.

### File: content/appendix_B.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Restructure and Relocate Appendix Content
* **Location:** Entire File
* **Original Text:**
    > (The entire content of `appendix_B.typ`)
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (This file should be deleted and its content redistributed as follows.)
    > 
    > 1.  **Move to `04_methodology.typ`**: The "Key Definitions" and "Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria" subsections are core methodological components and should be integrated directly into the main `Methodology` section. This consolidates all essential details for reproducibility in one place.
    > 2.  **Move to a new `Appendix A: Framework and Protocol Details`**: The tables "Analytical vs Creative Axes" and "Placing Representative Wargames on the Two-Axis Plot" are excellent supplementary materials that illustrate the paper's framework. They should form the basis of a new, focused Appendix A. The "scoping questions" block should also be moved here, presented with context as an example of the research protocol.
    > 3.  **Delete Redundant Content**: The "Economics and Finance" text at the end of the file is a duplicate of material already addressed in the `Discussion` section and should be removed.
* **Reasoning:** The current `appendix_B.typ` is a collection of disconnected notes, methodological details, and duplicate content. This structural refactoring dramatically improves the paper's organization. It places core methodology in the main text where readers expect it, creates a new, coherent appendix for detailed framework examples (as suggested by the `riedl` comments), and removes redundancy. This makes the paper clearer, more professional, and easier to navigate.

### File: content/cybersecurity_risks_discussion.typ

#### Suggestion 1: Integrate Cybersecurity Risks into the Main Paper
* **Location:** N/A (Structural suggestion)
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (In `content/07_safety.typ`, add a new subsection.)
    > 
    > == Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities
    > Beyond the inherent behavioral risks of LMs, their integration into wargaming platforms introduces a new technical attack surface. Practitioners must consider traditional cybersecurity threats as they apply to this novel context. These include data poisoning attacks against training corpora or fine-tuning datasets, which could subtly bias an agent's behavior, and prompt injection attacks designed to jailbreak an agent, causing it to ignore rules or exfiltrate sensitive game data. Furthermore, systems that rely on external APIs for model access are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks that could disrupt a wargame in progress. A more detailed taxonomy of these risks, covering assets, event types, and potential effects, is provided in Appendix C.
* **Reasoning:** The content in `cybersecurity_risks_discussion.typ` is highly valuable but completely disconnected from the paper. This suggestion integrates the key insights into the most logical location: the `Safety Considerations` section. It creates a new subsection that summarizes the risks in prose, making the information accessible to a broader audience while still retaining the expert analysis.

#### Suggestion 2: Create a Dedicated Appendix for Detailed Risks
* **Location:** N/A (Structural suggestion)
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (Create a new file, `content/appendix_C.typ`, and populate it with a cleaned-up version of the content from `cybersecurity_risks_discussion.typ`.)
    > 
    > = Appendix C: A Taxonomy of Cybersecurity Risks in LM-Wargaming
    > 
    > This appendix provides a detailed, non-exhaustive taxonomy of cybersecurity risks associated with LM-enabled wargaming, expanding on the summary provided in the `Safety Considerations` section.
    > 
    > (Insert the structured, cleaned-up list from the original file here.)
* **Reasoning:** The detailed, nested list in the original file is too granular for the main body of the paper but is extremely valuable for specialists. Moving it to a dedicated, clearly-labeled appendix preserves this detail for interested readers while keeping the main text focused. This also allows the new summary in the `Safety` section to be concise while referencing the appendix for a deeper dive.

#### Suggestion 3: Decommission Original File
* **Location:** `content/cybersecurity_risks_discussion.typ`
* **Original Text:** N/A
* **Suggested Revision:**
    > (Once the content has been moved to `07_safety.typ` and the new `appendix_C.typ`, this file should be deleted.)
* **Reasoning:** Deleting the original file after its contents have been integrated elsewhere will prevent confusion and ensure that there is a single, authoritative source for this information within the project structure.

## 3. Final Analysis Summary

This concludes the file-by-file analysis. The core manuscript is strong, with a clear and valuable central thesis (the quadrant framework). The primary areas for improvement are structural: many sections are incomplete, contain placeholder comments, or are disconnected from the main argument. The recommendations provided in this report focus on:

1.  **Completing the Narrative:** Filling in `TODO`s and empty sections with substantive content.
2.  **Strengthening the Argument:** Explicitly connecting the `Results`, `Discussion`, `Safety`, and `Recommendations` sections back to the quadrant framework.
3.  **Improving Structure and Readability:** Reorganizing the appendices and moving core methodological details into the main body of the paper.

By implementing these changes, the authors can transform the manuscript from a collection of promising notes into a cohesive, rigorous, and high-impact academic paper.
