==== Cyber risks overview
This section outlines representative cyber risks relevant to LM-enabled wargames; it is a non-exhaustive set intended to frame subsequent event/target/effect listings.
_*D4M:* Deny, degrade, disrupt, destroy, modify_
===== Asset: The AI/Agent Model
====== Event: Data D4M  
======= Event Targets: data types
  - Raw data (corpora) that may be included in training data, knowledge graphs, or searches
  - Training data sets
  - Model weights
  - Prompts
  - Agent packages (e.g., the set of files required for a user to install/integrate and deploy/use an AI agent)
======= Event Locations:
  - External (outside of the organization and its vendors or contractors): Internet, open-source, open-access data
  - Commercial/Contractor: commercial/vendor or contractor-owned or licensed resources, including closed-source and proprietary data, and curated external data
  - Organization: organization-owned or licensed resources, including closed-source or proprietary data, and curated commercial/vendor and external data
======= Event Effects:
The following aspects of a wargame that include AI in some manner may be denied, degraded, disrupted, destroyed, or modified: 
  - Wargame development (e.g., scenario or prompt generation)
  - Player or adjudicator behavior/decisions (e.g., unrealistically escalatory or de-escalatory, not aggressive/too aggressive, erratic, manipulative, non-compliant)
  - Adherence to rules
  - Chain-of-thought, reasoning logs, retrieval links
  - Meta-gaming
  - Agent jailbreaking to access game/meta-game
  - Agent jailbreaking to access information technology systems
Other effects may include:
  - Data exfiltration: wargame, meta-game, and non-game (organizational)
  - Information technology system exploitation and lateral movement into non-wargame systems
====== Event: API D4M
======= Event Targets: external and internal APIs
  - Open-access raw data providers (e.g., Internet databases, Wikipedia)
  - Commercial/contractor data providers (e.g., cloud storage)
  - Commercial/contractor AI providers (e.g., commercially hosted AI models)
======= Event Effects:
  - As above.

I could go into much more detail, but that would turn into a series of repetitive narratives about who/what/when/where/how. I could also cover other vectors that target the wargame system and related information (results, analysis, etc.), but that is typical cybersecurity scope.
