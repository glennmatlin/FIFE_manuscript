 We searched Google Scholar, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar using a series of queries based on Boolean logic and keywords to be filtered out for closer inspection. These papers were then deduplicated by arxiv/DOI, and each paper was screened by title/abstract before full‑text review. Our final set of #num_papers papers along with the complete description of our methodology can be found in Appendix B ...(TODO: properly link this to the right appendix section using typst functionality)...
