 SMEs have often classified wargames based on the primary skill required for success @deutschland_bundeswehr_wargaming_2017 @ukministryofdefense_WargamingHandbook_2017. One common method SMEs use is placing games somewhere on a spectrum spanning from analytical to creative based on the qualitative aspects and game mechanics
 @combe_ii_educational_2021 @de_rosa_design_2021 @ashdown_matrix_2018. Creative game types are those that are open-ended, non-linear games that heavily rely on creative problem solving, while the second is heavily structured and rule‑based games where analytical skills are more important @zegers_matrix_2011. These categories are respectively referred to as *creative wargames* and *analytical wargames* @franken_when_2013 @barzashka_five_2019.
 Open-ended games provide a far greater degree of creative freedom for players to identify the action needed to advance towards their goals and finish the game. Creativity offers players the freedom to identify unique paths to reach the victory condition, or even change the definition of the victory condition. Due to the open-ended nature of creative wargames, they have previously relied heavily on SMEs for
