// Evaluating AI in language-centric wargames presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional simulations with clear-cut rules and actions, these wargames are open-ended and revolve around natural language. This means that instead of discrete moves on a board, we have complex, high-dimensional text outputs representing arguments, justifications, and actions. This makes direct comparisons and reproducible evaluations difficult. Therefore, our analysis focuses not just on the outcomes of the games, but also on the quality, coherence, and plausibility of the language the AI agents use.
