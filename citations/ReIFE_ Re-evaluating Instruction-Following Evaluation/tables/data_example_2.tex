Research director at The Adam Smith Institute, Sam Bowman, suggests that building on London's green belt lands could provide bigger and cheaper homes for everyone. However, Ann Goddard of Elstree \& Borehamwood Greenbelt Society argues that green belt lands are important for recreation purposes and to maintain a separation between settlements. Bowman proposes a compromise by differentiating between areas of beauty and intensive farmland within the green belt.
