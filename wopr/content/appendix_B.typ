= Appendix B: Literature Review Protocols <app:lit-review-protocols>

== Key Definitions
+ *Artificial Intelligence (AI):* The use of computers to carry out tasks that previously required human intelligence.
+ *Wargame:* A multi‑faceted depiction of conflict with one or more parties in which the participants’ decisions influence the future outcomes of events.
+ *Open-ended:* Games where rules permit *unconstrained natural-language moves*, allowing players to propose novel actions beyond a preset menu. Outcomes are adjudicated by facilitators, subject matter experts, or dynamic rules rather than a fixed payoff matrix. Seminar wargames or negotiation-centric titles (e.g., _Twilight Imperium_) exemplify this approach, contrasting with constrained games like _Chess_ or _Go_ or rigid social games like _Werewolf_ or _Among Us_.
+ *Analytical wargame:* Formats that track numeric scores, payoffs, probabilities, or optimization objectives, though they may still contain open-ended dialogue components. Examples include _Chess_, _StarCraft II_, and other stochastic combat models.
+ *Creative wargame:* Games relying on narrative adjudication or subject matter expert judgment with minimal or no numeric scoring. Tabletop seminar games with after-action discussions represent this category.
+ *Language-centric game:* Formats where progress depends fundamentally on *textual or spoken communication* among actors (human or LM). Meta’s Cicero and conflict negotiations exemplify this approach @meta_fundamental_ai_research_diplomacy_team_human-level_2022, contrasting with action-based games like _StarCraft_, where LM-powered bots handle micromanagement.
