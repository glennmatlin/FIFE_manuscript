We highlight four priorities for language‑centric wargaming. (1) Persona modeling: methods that sustain coherent roles without leakage across levels, avoiding stylized archetypes that mask capability gaps. (2) Faithful interpretability for multi‑agent settings: tools that recover causal drivers of deception, negotiation, and opponent modeling without relying on unfaithful chain‑of‑thought. (3) Evaluation: metrics and protocols that measure strategic depth and long‑horizon planning, including LM‑judge reliability, cross‑model agreement, and SME‑anchored gold standards. (4) Robustness: techniques to detect and withstand distribution shift in open‑ended play (novel opponents, rules, prompts), with safety cases that specify boundaries and escalation controls. Progress also needs shared benchmarks, reproducible traces, and ablation‑friendly agents to turn qualitative insights into testable claims. Detailed prompts, design sketches, and citations for each direction appear in Appendix @app:future-work-details.
