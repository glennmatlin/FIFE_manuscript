We highlight four priority directions for future work in language‑centric wargaming: (1) persona modeling that avoids leakage across levels; (2) faithful interpretability for multi‑agent deception and opponent modeling; (3) evaluation methods for strategic depth and long‑horizon planning; and (4) robustness to out‑of‑distribution shifts in open‑ended settings. Detailed prompts and citations for each direction are provided in Appendix @app:future-work-details.
