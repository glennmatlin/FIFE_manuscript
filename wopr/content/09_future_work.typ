We highlight several priorities for integration of LM wargaming agents, with sepcific open questions and promising areas of research provided in @app:future-work-details. 
- *Evaluation Methods:* There exist no standard evaluation methods or protocols that measure agent ability over long tasks interleaving human interactions @reddie_next-generation_2018 @downes-martin_wargaming_2025 @reddie_wargames_2023. Additionally, because using LMs as judges introduces systematic errors @li_llms-as-judges_2024, it is difficult to construct benchamrks without expensive SME trials @wei_recommendations_2025. 
- *Faithful Interpretability*: CoT often proves unfaithful @turpin_language_2023, and current interpretability methods cannot recover explanations for tactical decisions in multi-agent wargaming involving deception and opponent modeling. Sparse autoencoders @cunningham_sparse_2023 and activation patching @ravindran_adversarial_2025 offer alternatives.
- *Robustness to distributional shifts*: Brittle wargaming agent behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios can cause failures in novel environments (CITE: balloch, geigh, and the people they cite). OOD detection methods @liang_principled_2017 require validation in multi-agent transformer settings with latent distributional shifts @smith_understanding_2024.
- *Long-horizon planning and world models:* Player agents require sophisticated planning algorithms to generate and evaluate alternative long-horizon strategies matching realistic teammates and adversaries. World models predicting move effects enable principled plan rollouts. While common in reinforcement learning, their integration with LM externalized reasoning remains poorly understood.
- *Persona modeling:* Reliable elicitation and maintenance of coherent hierarchical personas without behavioral leakage between levels remains challenging. Activation steering shows promise @turner_steering_2024 @chalnev_improving_2024 @chen_persona_2025 but remains brittle and unpredictable @tan_analyzing_2025 @hao_patterns_2025.
