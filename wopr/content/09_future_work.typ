Standardize reporting for language‑based wargames: share prompts, facilitation procedures, and
adjudication rubrics with seeds and model versions @reddie_nextgeneration_2018. Expand beyond short horizons by testing
memory, retrieval, and role‑stability over multi‑turn scenarios. Compare lightweight
interventions (system prompts, few‑shot ICL, adapters) with simple baselines. Encourage
artifact release (transcripts, code, minimal configs) to enable replication across venues @reddie_wargames_2023.
