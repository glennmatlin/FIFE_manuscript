Wargaming is a cognitive tool for subject matter experts to explore implications of strategic decision-making. It is not just for defense; it can be applied to many domains including entertainment.
To better understand the space of games, we present a novel ontology that considers the creative range of moves afforded to players and adjudicators.
Wargames that address open-ended problem spaces and/or social dynamics are played with natural language descriptions of moves. 
Language models can be useful tools in conducting creative, language-based games. 
How LMs are used in wargames can be domain-specific. 
Additionally there are reasons why LMs can, without careful consideration of how they are employed, raise safety concerns with respect to how they affect human decision-making and inferences drawn from the wargaming exercises.
Finally, we present open research questions that will make LMs more effective and also address the broader goals of artificial intelligence.


// We present a framework for understanding and deploying language models in open-ended wargaming scenarios through a novel two-dimensional taxonomy that separates player and adjudicator creativity. Our scoping literature review demonstrates that while analytical wargames have dominated AI research, the most strategically valuable applications lie in Quadrant IV environments where both players and adjudicators operate creatively. Qualitative domain analysis across military, diplomatic, business, and public health contexts reveals both significant opportunities and critical safety considerations that require careful mitigation strategies. We identify several research questions and methodological recommendations, seeking to bridge the critical gap between AI researchers and wargaming practitioners and enable more informed integration of AI systems in strategic decision-making contexts.
