= Conclusions
LMs are reshaping how open-ended and language‑centric wargames can be designed and studied, but progress
depends on clarity about roles, formats, and evaluation. A discussion‑style synthesis helps the
community converge on practical choices that preserve the strengths of human‑facilitated play
while making careful use of automation. We hope the references and patterns here accelerate
responsible exploration in defense, policy, and organizational settings.
