= Impact Statement
This work consolidates emerging practices for incorporating LMs into open‑ended, language‑
centric wargames. The primary impact is practical: clearer reporting, lightweight evaluation,
and reproducible artifacts that support analysts and researchers. We aim to reduce duplicated
effort, surface trade‑offs transparently, and improve the interpretability of results used in
security and policy contexts.
