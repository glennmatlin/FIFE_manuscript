In this section, we review other literature reviews and surveys on the topic of language models in games and simulations.

A growing body of work surveys the use of Large Language Models (LMs) in games. These surveys cover a wide range of topics, from strategic reasoning @zhang_llm_2024, to the architecture of game agents @hu_survey_2025, and the general application of LMs in games @xu_survey_2024, including aspects of randomness and strategy @vidler_playing_2025. Other work has focused on benchmarking the strategic and social reasoning capabilities of LMs @yao_spin-bench_2025, or their use as social agents in game-theoretic scenarios @feng_survey_2025.

While these surveys provide a valuable overview of the field, they tend to focus on games with well-defined rules and clear win conditions. Our work, by contrast, focuses on a specific sub-domain: open-ended, language-based wargames. These wargames are characterized by their qualitative nature, ambiguous rules, and the importance of narrative and argumentation. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a scoping literature review and a comprehensive research agenda specifically for this class of wargames.
