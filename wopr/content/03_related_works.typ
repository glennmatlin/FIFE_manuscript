== Artificial Intelligence in Wargaming 
//@li_exploration_2025
//@davis_artificial_2025
Early AI for wargaming largely targeted quantitative or tightly scoped simulations: search and
optimization for move planning, stochastic combat models, and agent‑based systems with
explicit state. Such approaches perform well in rigid games but offer limited support for
open‑ended narrative argumentation and multi‑party persuasion typical of seminar and matrix formats.

Across these threads, reporting is heterogeneous and evaluation often short‑horizon or
subjective; prompts and facilitation procedures are rarely standardized; and open‑ended,
qualitative wargames remain under‑served. Our discussion consolidates approaches for
language‑based formats and highlights practical choices that affect realism and utility.
