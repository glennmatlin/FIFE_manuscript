A growing body of work surveys the use of Language Models (LMs) in games and covers topics from strategic reasoning @zhang_llm_2024, game theory @sun_game_2025, and benchmarking social reasoning and persuasion @yao_spin-bench_2025 @park_ai_2023 @feng_survey_2025. Areas of interest in agent-based research also include surveys on traditional models and simulations. These include agent architecture @hu_survey_2025, modeling @gao_large_2024, simulation @ma_computational_2024, and general applications @xu_survey_2024

While valuable, these surveys focus on games with well-defined rules and clear win conditions. In contrast, our work focuses on the sub-domain of open-ended, language-based wargames characterized by their qualitative nature, ambiguous rules, and the importance of narrative and argumentation. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping literature review and comprehensive research agenda for this class of wargames.
