We conducted a scoping literature review @arksey_scoping_2005 @tricco_prisma_2018 across Google Scholar, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar using a series of queries based on Boolean logic and keywords to be filtered out for closer inspection. These papers were then de-duplicated by arXiv or DOI, and each paper was screened by title/abstract before full‑text review. Our final set of #num_papers papers can be found in @sec:wargames
We adopted the definition of “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) as “the use of computers to carry out tasks that previously required human intelligence” @minsky_semantic_1968. This broad definition is intentional. While much of the recent excitement in AI for wargaming is driven by LMs, our survey is not exclusively focused on LMs. We consider any system that meets this definition of AI, including symbolic AI, expert systems, and other machine learning approaches. This allows us to provide a more comprehensive overview of the field and its historical context.
Single-move games or LM polling presented as games were excluded due to a lack of interactivity. Opinion or editorial pieces without research content, including any blog posts that lack technical appendices or methodology, were not included. Studies were only included if they met all of the following criteria:
- Publication year 2020-2025 to ensure LM relevance.
- Includes the use of technologies or methods that would commonly be understood to be considered artificial intelligence.
- AIs serving as players or adjudicators, which includes a breadth of other terminology used, e.g., AI agent, world model, state generator.
- Provision of any evaluation outcome (quantitative metrics, subject matter expert narratives, or explicit statement of “none”) as needed for synthesis.
- Full text accessibility in English, or with an acceptable machine translation.
- Pre-print available online with a preference for work that was either published with peer-review, or reports from authoritative sources (e.g., RAND, DoD, MoD).
