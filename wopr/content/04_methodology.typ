= Methodology
We conducted a scoping literature review @arksey_scoping_2005 @tricco_prisma_2018.
We searched Google Scholar, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar using a series of queries based on Boolean logic and keywords to be filtered out for closer inspection. These papers were then de-duplicated by arXiv or DOI, and each paper was screened by title/abstract before full‑text review. Our final set of #num_papers papers along with the complete description of our methodology can be found in @app:lit-review-protocols.
... Single-move polls or surveys presented as games due to lack of interactivity. Opinion or editorial pieces without research content, including any blog posts which lack technical appendices or methodology. ...
... Studies were included if they met all of the following criteria:
- Publication year 2020 or later to ensure GPT-era relevance.
- Includes the use of technologies or methods that would commonly be understood to considered artificial intelligence.
- AIs serving as agents, adjudicators, or generators to ensure breadth of roles.
- Provision of any evaluation outcome (quantitative metrics, subject matter expert narratives, or explicit statement of “none”) as needed for synthesis.
- Full text accessibility in English, or with an acceptable machine translation.
- Publications available online from peer-reviewed venues or reports from authoritative sources (RAND, CNA, DoD, MoD). Pre-prints were included, but flagged.

In line with our broad definition of AI, we did not limit our search to a specific class of AI models (e.g. Language Models), but included a wide range of AI techniques.
