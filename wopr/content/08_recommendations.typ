// = Recommendations for LMs in Wargames
// Given LMs’ distinctive failure modes, deployments in wargaming should adopt layered controls that make errors observable, bounded, and recoverable. At minimum: (1) establish task‑specific baselines and scenario hold‑outs so performance is interpretable relative to human SMEs and deterministic agents; (2) test robustness by varying paraphrases, seeds, roles, and prompt styles to surface brittle strategies; (3) require calibration and uncertainty reporting that gates actions (e.g., low‑confidence routes to human review); (4) audit validation robustness with cross‑model agreement checks and evaluation‑awareness probes; (5) run continuous red‑teaming and keep incident logs with replayable traces; and (6) train operators, provide playbooks, and practice rollback and containment. High‑stakes use should also separate privileges (data, tools, and actuation), enforce human‑in‑the‑loop decision points, and document scenario assumptions and limits so conclusions are not over‑generalized. Details and citations for each control appear in Appendix @app:recommendations-details.
