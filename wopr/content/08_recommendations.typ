Given LMs' unique error profile, practitioners should adopt in-depth output monitoring and red-teaming measures to mitigate wargaming-specific risks. For high-stakes applications in sensitive fields, these should include task-specific baseline comparisons, robustness testing, calibration assessments, validation robustness checks, and comprehensive human stakeholder training. Each of these recommendations is discussed in detail in Appendix @app:recommendations-details.
