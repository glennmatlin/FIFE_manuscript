	abstract = {Kriegsspiel is a genre of wargaming developed by the Prussian Army in the 19th century to teach battlefield tactics to officers. The word Kriegsspiel literally means "wargame" in German, but in the context of the English language it refers specifically to the wargames developed by the Prussian army in the 19th century. Kriegsspiel was the first wargaming system to have been adopted by a military organization as a serious tool for training and research.
It is characterized by high realism, an emphasis on the experience of decision-making rather than on competition, and the use of an umpire to keep the rules flexible and manage hidden information. After Prussia's impressive victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War, other countries began designing similar wargames for their own armies.
Most forms of Kriegsspiel involve at least two teams of players and one umpire gathered around a map. The map represents a battlefield. Each team is given command of an imaginary army which is represented on the map using little painted blocks. Each block represents some kind of troop formation, such as an artillery battery or a cavalry squadron.  The players command their troops by writing their orders on paper and giving them to the umpire. The umpire will then read these orders and move the blocks across the map according to how he judges the imaginary troops would interpret and execute their orders. The outcomes of combat are determined either by simple mathematical calculations or the umpire's judgement.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic crisis has fundamentally changed the way we live and work forever. The business sector is forecasting and formulating different scenarios associated with the impact of the pandemic on its employees, customers, and suppliers. Various business retrieval models are under construction to cope with life after the {COVID}-19 Pandemic Crisis. However, the proposed plans and scenarios are static and cannot address the dynamic pandemic changes worldwide. They also have not considered the peripheral in-between scenarios to propel the shifting paradigm of businesses from the existing condition to the new one. Furthermore, the scenario drivers in the current studies are generally centered on the economic aspects of the pandemic with little attention to the social facets. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing scenario planning and analytics to study the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on large-scale information technology-led Companies. The primary and peripheral scenarios are constructed based on a balanced set of business continuity and employee health drivers. Practical action plans are formulated for each scenario to devise plausible responses. Finally, a damage management framework is developed to cope with the mental disorders of the employees amid the disease.},

However, most of these studies still focus on conceptual discussions, terminology, or the proposal for frameworks that do not take advantage of the evolution of information and communication technologies. In this paper, authors discussed the lack of tools to computationally support {WS} handling. In response to this lack, a computational tool was developed considering a previously published method for {WS} classification based on conceptual systems. This tool was applied and evaluated in experimental cases about surprising events that occurred in politics in recent years, considering traditional metrics of information retrieval. Experiments illustrate that organizations can create several conceptual systems to represent different scenarios and types of knowledge; after all, results showed that the tool can operate according to different artifacts of knowledge representation. This capacity is useful to mitigate the effects of the surveillance filter though the evidence does not directly confirm its usefulness for the monitoring activities. Furthermore, the tool provides a list of threats, opportunities and unlabeled {WS} that can trigger other steps of sensemaking about these signals.},

We propose such an approach in order to develop scenarios for a contemporary, technology-driven and fast-moving industry such as Interactive Digital Media. Our approach, while essentially qualitative in nature, nevertheless draws from the rigors of quantitative methods in identifying and then tracking the significant Dimensions of Analysis that impact the industry. The capture and analysis of real-time events was automated by an off-the-shelf web crawler with analytic functions, thus making our approach scalable over a larger scope and for longer periods of time. A morphological technique using Multidimensional Scaling isolated strands within the events leading to the identification of trends. This was followed by the mapping of strands to three emergent themes — ownership, distribution and innovation — which were used in an expert construction exercise to formulate plausible scenarios. We suggest that the approach we describe is particularly applicable for dynamic scenario planning that requires revisiting key assumptions and market conditions on a regular basis. We conclude that the ability to develop strategic narratives is the overriding benefit of scenario planning rather than the purported ability to predict the future.},

While exogenous uncertainty influences the growth option market value or price, it is endogenous uncertainty that influences the value of the growth option through the ability to create a competitive advantage from preemptive market entry. First, the firm can decrease the exercise price of the growth option (i.e., the cost of the follow-on investment) through experiential learning that reduces endogenous uncertainty. Second, the firm can increase the relative discounted cash flows of the follow-on investment due to its ability to influence market demand that reduces endogenous uncertainty. On the other hand, the value of the deferral option increases with exogenous uncertainty as firms cannot influence exogenous uncertainty, and therefore, should invest elsewhere while waiting for the exogenous uncertainty to subside. As such, we provide a solution to the conundrum that the value of both the growth option and the deferral option increase with uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate how the model addresses sequential market entry; irreversibility and market entry mode; competition; scarce strategic resources; host country development level; and industry life cycle stage.},

	abstract = {Reducing the potential damage caused by a wildfire is a problem of significant importance to land and fire managers. Fuel reduction treatment is a well-known method of reducing the risk of fire occurrence and spread on landscapes. However, officials seeking fuel reduction treatments on privately owned lands can only encourage it through incentive programs such as cost-share programs. This research developed a methodology that provides the basis for a decision-making tool to help managers allocate limited cost-share resources among a set of landowners to maximize wildfire risk reduction by implementing a hazardous fuel reduction treatment. A key feature of the methodology is that it incorporates uncertainty in the landowners’ decision of whether or not to implement treatment on their lands. The methodology is based on a stochastic programming model with endogenous uncertainty where the probability that a landowner accepts a cost-share offer to implement a fuel reduction treatment on their land depends on the offer amount. To estimate the probability that a landowner accepts a given cost-share offer amount, we used a predictive modeling technique to analyze landowner survey data. The results provide insight about the effects of different cost-share allocation strategies on the expected damage. Numerical experiments show that the risk-based allocation provides up to 37.3\% more reduction in damage compared to other strategies that allocate equal cost-share amounts among landowners. Additionally, the results show that the solution quality is substantially sensitive to changes in the number of resource allocation levels.},

deception to robust risk-assessment requirements; second, policymakers

	abstract = {Energy industries face major future challenges related to environment, security, and economics. Here we present a scenario-building framework based on the Global Business Network ({GBN}) method to help energy industries to develop more resilient conservation policies when faced with unpredictable and external uncertainties. The approach combines several foresight methods such as Delphi; Political, Economical, Social, and Technological ({PEST}) analysis, and Cross-Impact Analysis ({CIA}). In addition, a strategic foresight software program ({MICMAC}) was applied in the scenario-building phase. The proposed integrated scenario-based robust planning approach builds on the strengths of traditional scenario planning, but overcomes its weaknesses by offering a systematic process for scenario creation and easy implementation. The outcome of this approach is a limited range of core strategies. We use Iran as the case for a more detailed application of the method. Foreign investments in the energy industry, external economic sanctions, and the domestic energy consumption growth were found as the key drivers and critical uncertainties in the Iranian energy industry. Three scenarios based on these critical uncertainties and expert information were developed: Technology-driven, Stagnation, and Self-sufficiency scenario. For these scenarios, a range of robust strategies was determined. National energy efficiency and productivity increases emerged as the key factors for robustness. The main macro-level result was that economic and political drivers will be the most important factors for Iran's energy futures followed by technological and social factors.},

	abstract = {A highly uncertain future due to changes in climate, technology and socio-economics has led to the realisation that identification of “best-guess” future conditions might no longer be appropriate. Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper presents a multidisciplinary perspective on how the above factors fit together to facilitate the development of strategies that are best suited to dealing with a deeply uncertain future.},

Our research design is an in-depth, longitudinal case study of Nokia and its response to mobile Internet between the late 1990s and the mid-2010s. We show that Nokia diligently analyzed the competitive dynamics of other industries, such as the personal computer industry, that had already been affected by the same technological discontinuities and used the lessons from these industries to anticipate future competition outcomes in the mobile phone business. We also show that analogical reasoning helped Nokia's managers change the beliefs developed through their prior experiences. However, Nokia's managers became overconfident in their new beliefs, and this overconfidence constrained their cognitive processes of attention and interpretation, thereby increasing organizational inertia. This constraint was particularly evident in the new belief that the software operating system was the essential source of product differentiation. This belief directed key investment decisions for over a decade and contributed to the eventual decline of Nokia by leading the company to embrace Microsoft's Windows Phone rather than Google's Android.},

	abstract = {The Paris Agreement's aspirational 1.5 degree temperature target has given further impetus to efforts to imagine (and seek to govern) transformative and uncertain climate futures. This brings to the fore multiple challenges in the search for anticipatory governance and the role herein for climate foresight. Foresight entails processes to envision challenging futures and question limiting assumptions about what futures are possible, but these processes also impact upon present-day politics. While foresight-related activities are proliferating in sustainability research and planning, critical social science scrutiny of such processes remains minimal. Two key gaps in understanding are: (a) the link between foresight, planning and policy change; and (b) the very prospects of relying on foresight in the present to steer largely unknowable futures. In addressing these gaps, we review the field of climate foresight research here, situating it within a broader interdisciplinary body of literature relating to anticipation and anticipatory governance. In doing so, we identify a conceptual lens through which to analyze the political implications of foresight processes, and apply it to the case of two ongoing foresight initiatives. We conclude with noting the urgent need for further research on the role of foresight within anticipatory climate governance in a post-Paris era.},

the context of global governance and international security. Rapid
digitalization has changed the way international actors interact, offering
new opportunities for international and bilateral cooperation and
reinforcing the role of the emergent actors within global governance. New
phenomena linked to digitalization and artificial intelligence are
emerging and this volume brings a multidisciplinary, mixed-methods
approach to studying them. Written by globally recognized experts, each
chapter presents a case study covering an emerging topic such as:
international regulation of the web and digital diplomacy, the interplay
of artificial intelligence and cyber diplomacy, social media and
artificial intelligence as tools for digital diplomacy, the malicious use
of artificial intelligence, cyber security, and data sovereignty.
Incorporating both theory and practice, quantitative and qualitative
analysis, this volume will be of interest to graduate students and
researchers in international relations, diplomacy, security studies, and
artificial intelligence, as well as diplomats and policymakers looking to
understand the implications of digitalization and artificial intelligence

We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence ({AI}) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in {AI}. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in {AI} and provide a crucial step towards developing {AI} systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.},

Based on a random sample of 368 Polish tourism firms, we run exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to find that antecedents used in coopetition literature converge into two latent, behavioral constructs. Our data substantiate the view that coopetition is an intentional strategy, driven by a strategic rationale. Managers are found to pursue coopetition in order to reach clearly defined benefits with fitting partners. Moreover, three elements are found to converge in the coopetitive mindset latent construct: orientation to cooperation, trust, and experience in coopetition. We contribute to the methodological advancement of measurement instruments with applicability potential in future research examining the behavioral antecedents of coopetition. We also advance the behavioral stream of research in strategy by empirically identifying the connection between rational and behavioral antecedents of firms’ coopetitive strategic behavior.},

The seller is initially uninformed about the attributes' values, and each period he decides whether to make a price offer or to costlessly inspect an attribute's value. The buyer does not know the attributes' values, but he may or may not observe which inspections were performed (we consider both cases). We study the seller's strategic scheduling of inspections and its effect on the realized gains from trade in equilibrium. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the players can realize some gains from trade, and all gains from trade.},

The board wargaming hobby continues to enjoy a sizeable following, with a number of game publishers and gaming conventions dedicated to the hobby both in the English-speaking world and further afield.
In the United States, commercial board wargames (often shortened to "wargames" for brevity) were popularized in the early 1970s. Elsewhere, notably Great Britain where miniatures had evolved its own commercial hobby,  a smaller following developed. The genre is still known for a number of common game-play conventions (or game mechanics) that were developed early on.
The early history of board wargaming was dominated by The Avalon Hill Game Company, while other companies such as {SPI} also gained importance in the history of the genre.},

Reporting on research into the scenario planning process of two organizations, we find that scenario planning generates new social capital through learning with the conceptual future, which is a direct investment in building new shared systems of meaning – the cognitive dimension of social capital. This then enables the structural and relational dimensions of new social capital to emerge as by-products. The building of new social capital provides another purpose for scenario investments and another quality criterion by which to assess the value of these interventions. The insights of the research will be of interest to: scenario planning scholars; leaders interested in how to purposefully design and conduct scenario planning if a core intent is to build new social capital; and scholars interested in the cognitive dimension of social capital and its creation.},

We show that the prevalence of difficult-choice situations in equilibrium is related to the magnitude of the choice procrastination effect. In general, features of the choice procedure that are typically viewed as biases tend to “protect” the decision maker, in the sense that they encourage competitors to offer higher-value alternatives in equilibrium.

	abstract = {Business war gaming, corporate war gaming or business wargaming  is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting. In a complex global and competitive world, formulating a plan without testing it against likely external reactions is the equivalent of walking into a battlefield without the right weapons or a plan to win. In situations where the cost of being wrong is high, war games can be very helpful to understand from a 360-degree perspective the external opportunities and challenges of all the key stakeholders in the industry.
Unlike military war games or fantasy war games, which can be set hundreds of years in the past, business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development, but they are growing rapidly.
The rationale for running a business war game is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change, as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change, and to each other. A "moderate level of uncertainty" provides the best setting for a business war game. The benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable, and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from Richard Clark, {CEO} of Merck and Co., who in an interview to {USA} Today said: "I am a strong believer in if you’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that…it can’t be just the {CEO} or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room."
War games are used by many companies globally, and they are taught at some {MBA} programs.},

The process steps for wargaming, important lessons to follow, and a case study are all presented in this article. Wargames offer unique benefits at two points in an organization’s strategic planning process: (1) at its outset, wargames are helpful to convert data and information (about markets, channels, competitors, etc.) into actionable intelligence for subsequent planning; (2) after a basic plan is developed, a wargame can test the plan to ensure it is robust enough to succeed in any realistic combination of events or actions. Attributes of a business wargame: (1) it involves intense competition among five to ten teams, each representing a distinct stakeholder (such as the market, key customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, channels, regulators); (2) the team interact based both on quantitative and qualitative information. Through the use of role playing, cultural issues, rivalries and other subjective factors guide development and assessment of strategies; (3) the wargame process forces a rigorous exam of a situation from multiple perspectives. The various points of view (some hostile) allow the company to recognize opportunities and threats otherwise not noticed using just an “inside‐out” approach; and (4) the gaming allows a broad range of ideas to be developed while the teams aggressively compete to outsmart each other. The time, cost, and effort in preparing a major wargame are spelled out. The case illustrates the potential pay‐off in situations where the wargame makes strategic choices apparent.},

However, even a relatively low number of dimensions in future conditions can lead to hundreds or even thousands of plausible future scenarios. Creating highly diverse but conceivable visions of the future in which to explore decision-making, exploratory futures techniques rely on the selection of a small number of plausible scenarios from the larger set. In this paper we describe a new method for finding maximally diverse sets containing a small number of plausible scenarios from a multi-dimensional morphological analysis. It is based on a mathematical optimization of diversity that is robust to the uncertainty in the framing of future factors and states and in what stakeholders might consider diverse combinations of those factors and states. We also describe implementation of the method as a software tool and its performance in recent exploratory scenario development by {CGIAR} and partners for regional environmental change, food security and livelihoods.},

While techniques such as business wargaming can effectively support this process, such techniques can benefit from placing competitive considerations within a broader future landscape shaped by geopolitical, social, technological and economic forces. Scenario planning allows for the exploration of interactions across multiple external forces to create a rich set of narratives on how the future may unfold. This paper will discuss the potential of combining scenario planning and business wargaming to enable strategists to anticipate moves and countermoves and foresee their consequences. We use a real-life case study to illustrate how a scenario-planning exercise can guide the crucial stage of selecting relevant future competitors of a firm prior to engaging in a business-war-gaming exercise. We then introduce what we term the prospective competitive strategy process to guide the analysis of potential competitive dynamics, emphasizing the synergies between scenario planning and business wargaming.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00262},
	abstract = {Computational experiments have emerged as a valuable method for studying
complex systems, involving the algorithmization of counterfactuals.
However, accurately representing real social systems in Agent-based
Modeling ({ABM}) is challenging due to the diverse and intricate
characteristics of humans, including bounded rationality and
heterogeneity. To address this limitation, the integration of Large
Language Models ({LLMs}) has been proposed, enabling agents to possess
anthropomorphic abilities such as complex reasoning and autonomous
learning. These agents, known as {LLM}-based Agent, offer the potential to
enhance the anthropomorphism lacking in {ABM}. Nonetheless, the absence of
explicit explainability in {LLMs} significantly hinders their application in
the social sciences. Conversely, computational experiments excel in
providing causal analysis of individual behaviors and complex phenomena.
Thus, combining computational experiments with {LLM}-based Agent holds
substantial research potential. This paper aims to present a comprehensive
exploration of this fusion. Primarily, it outlines the historical
development of agent structures and their evolution into artificial
societies, emphasizing their importance in computational experiments. Then
it elucidates the advantages that computational experiments and {LLM}-based
Agents offer each other, considering the perspectives of {LLM}-based Agent
for computational experiments and vice versa. Finally, this paper
addresses the challenges and future trends in this research domain,
offering guidance for subsequent related studies.},

We experiment with methods for training a harmless {AI} assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional {AI}'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the {RL} phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of {AI} preferences. We then train with {RL} using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use '{RL} from {AI} Feedback' ({RLAIF}). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive {AI} assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the {SL} and {RL} methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of {AI} decision making. These methods make it possible to control {AI} behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

Data were obtained from 49 primary studies involving 62,057 participants. Our results confirm that coopetition has a significantly positive impact on overall organizational performance. Specifically, coopetition is significantly positively related to financial, market, and innovation performance. Moreover, the coopetition–performance relationship is contingent on two environmental factors (i.e., national culture and industry type), one organizational relationship factor (i.e., coopetition structure), and two methodological factors (i.e., coopetition and performance measures). This study thus extends the coopetition literature by resolving the mixed findings regarding this relationship and emphasizing the fundamental significance of contingent factors.},

their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified
utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism

Understanding how to present the situation and define the environment is central to creating a learning exercise where decision makers can improve their decision-making performance. It is an important pedagogical issue to know whether the business simulation is being designed to reinforce and build a decision maker’s ability to respond in a normative reasoned fashion to a decision problem, or to experience the situation in its complexity and respond in a synthetic intuitive fashion. To comprehend the implications of these two viewpoints the debate between promoters of the normative view on decision making and the descriptive view on decision making are presented. A critical analysis of these different perspectives is shown to influence how decision making should be taught, how simulations should be designed, and how learning outcomes should be measured.},

His significant practical contribution was the establishment of the Australian Foresight Institute and postgraduate studies at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. It is suggested that the foresight field in Australia needs to reestablish supportive structures such as these and take steps to obtain social and professional legitimation in order to promote an advanced futures discourse to take us toward better futures.},

The scenario planning process can help deal with uncertainties in an increasingly dynamic environment, particularly if they are perceived as plausible. To explore the practicalities of developing plausible scenarios we utilised a case study, and involved key stakeholders, to investigate the ‘Future of Work’ in Dunedin, Aotearoa, New Zealand. Using sensemaking analysis we show how participants utilized their individual frames of reference to interpret how plausible the scenarios were, while also constructing cues to prospectively ‘make sense’. Therefore, we contribute both to understanding how to build plausibility into scenario planning and how participants make sense of future scenarios. We propose a model, based on the sensemaking concepts of frames and cues, that supports the construction of plausible scenarios. We conclude that designing plausible scenarios, as a prospective sensemaking device, is a powerful way to encourage discussion about futures and to understand the consequences of today's activities on tomorrow's realities. Understanding how to design scenarios that are perceived as plausible from a stakeholder's perspective is crucial for building understandings of future events.},

faster and more reliably than humans can. So is it also possible to use {AI}

through two exploratory case studies. The first examines the negotiations
for a German-Austrian customs union in 1929/30. Here we show how {AI}
systems could be used to develop a spectrum of possible scenarios in an
automated way for the purposes of strategy formation. ∎ The second case
study looks at the negotiations on the so-called “cybercrime” resolution
within the framework of the United Nations ({UN}). In cooperation with the
Federal Foreign Office ({AA}), the study investigates whether and in what
form {AI} systems allow the behaviour of states in the {UN} General Assembly
to be predicted. ∎ Based on the two case studies, we take a systematic
look at further possibilities for using {AI} as a tool for diplomacy, for
example, in the automated monitoring of public media around a negotiation
process. ∎ Today, {AI} is still often prone to error and will foreseeably
not be able to replace the judgement of experienced diplomats. As a
supporting tool, however, {AI} has the potential to make an indispensable
contribution to the preparation and conduct of diplomatic negotiations. ∎
German foreign policy should create the conditions to further explore the
potential of {AI} and other methods of data analysis for the purposes of
diplomatic negotiations, develop a “foreign policy data strategy” and draw
up normative guidelines for the use of {AI} in the context of diplomacy.},

A major challenge of individual-based modeling is that it addresses complex systems that include a large number of entities, hierarchical levels, and processes. To represent these, individual-based models ({IBMs}) usually comprise a large number of submodels. These submodels might be complex by themselves and interact with each other in many ways, which in turn can affect the overall system behavior in ways that are not always easy to understand. As a result, both the validity and credibility of {IBMs} can be limited. We here demonstrate how a cascaded design of simulation experiments ({cDOE}) may support the validity and efficiency of the analysis of {IBMs} and other ecological simulation models. We take a systematic approach that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy. In a preparatory phase, submodels and their parameters are configured in “subexperiments”. Consequently, the “top-level experiments” of the simulation model can assess the research questions in a more valid and efficient way. Our strategy thus supports the structural realism of individual-based models because both the behavior of their main components and the relationships between these components are explicitly addressed.},

Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously
explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve

domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics
with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock

While there are many descriptions of the benefits of foresight, there is little research into how these benefits are created. In addition, although the view of innovations has shifted towards a systems understanding, the same has not happened with foresight, which is largely seen as a process. The process view and focus on the outcomes has created a situation where the dynamics between agents involved in foresight is still not well understood. One emerging approach to improve the understanding of the dynamics of foresight, and to embed foresight more closely with innovation management and policy, is the systems view. In this paper, we build on the systems view of foresight, and study what the elements in foresight as a system are and how they contribute to the creation of futures knowledge. Based on the literature, we propose six elements that are useful for understanding a foresight system and the creation of futures knowledge: agents, cognitive schemes, strategic objects, mediating events, memory objects and metaphors. We illustrate the systems view, the elements and their interaction with two case examples: one on creating future-orientation in a research and technology organisation and one on renewing a forest industry through roadmapping. Based on the elements and the case studies, we argue that the strategic objects and mediating events are important leverage points when steering foresight as a system.},

Drawing on political science and international relations literature about escalation dynamics, we design a novel wargame simulation and scoring framework to assess the escalation risks of actions taken by these agents in different scenarios. Contrary to prior studies, our research provides both qualitative and quantitative insights and focuses on large language models ({LLMs}). We find that all five studied off-the-shelf {LLMs} show forms of escalation and difficult-to-predict escalation patterns. We observe that models tend to develop arms-race dynamics, leading to greater conflict, and in rare cases, even to the deployment of nuclear weapons. Qualitatively, we also collect the models’ reported reasoning for chosen actions and observe worrying justifications based on deterrence and first-strike tactics. Given the high stakes of military and foreign-policy contexts, we recommend further examination and cautious consideration before deploying autonomous language model agents for strategic military or diplomatic decision-making.},

Scenarios are often used by organisations to explore how their external environment may develop in the future and to consider its impact on their strategy. However, in order to develop strategy, an organisation needs also to consider the internal environment, in terms of its resources and capabilities, such as that presented within the Resource-Based View of the firm ({RBV}). This paper proposes a novel methodology for enhancing the scenario method through its serial integration with a method from the {RBV} field, namely that of resource mapping. The methodology provides the ability to support the "rehearsal" of a firm's strategic performance over time by exploring how the firm's resources and capabilities interact with the competitive environment and with the various scenarios. We illustrate our proposed method with an example of its use in a teaching setting by a group of postgraduate students along with a short description of its application within a company. We reflect on the design of the method and the early experiences of using it. The main contribution of the proposed method is that it provides an integrated approach linking scenarios with strategy development and evaluation. The paper ends with suggestions for further research.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) promises to be the most powerful technology
in generations for expanding knowledge, increasing prosperity, and
enriching the human experience. {AI} and associated technologies will be the
foundation of the innovation economy and a source of enormous power for
countries that harness them. {AI} will fuel competition between governments
and companies racing to field it. And it will be employed by nation states
to pursue their strategic ambitions.Congress established the National
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence ({NSCAI}) to examine the
impact of {AI} and make recommendations to the President and Congress. The
fifteen commissioners represent a bipartisan group of technologists,
national security professionals, business executives, and academic
leaders. They have concluded that the United States is not organized or
investing to win the technology competition against a committed competitor
nor is it prepared to defend against {AI}-enabled threats and rapidly adopt
{AI} applications for national security purposes. The {NSCAI} Final Report
presents its recommendations as an integrated national strategy to
reorganize the government, reorient the nation, and rally our closest
allies and partners to defend and lead in the coming era of {AI}-accelerated
competition and conflict. It is a two-pronged approach. Part I, "Defending
America in the {AI} Era," outlines the stakes and what the United States
must do to defend against the spectrum of {AI}-related threats, and
recommends how the U.S. government can responsibly use {AI} technologies to
protect the American people and our interests. Part {II}, "Winning the
Technology Competition," addresses the critical elements of the {AI}
competition, and recommends actions the government must take to promote {AI}
innovation to improve national competitiveness and protect critical U.S.

	abstract = {A new type of warfare is upon us. In this new mode of war, finance is the
most powerful weapon, bullets are not fired, financial institutions are
the targets, and almost everyone is at risk. Instead of smart bombs,
improvised explosives, and unmanned drones –– economic sanctions,
financial restrictions, and cyber programs are the weapons of choice. This
is the reality of modern financial warfare. This Article offers an early
examination of this new mode of war. It explores the new financial theater
of war, analyzes the modern arsenal of financial weapons, highlights
emerging legal tensions, and proposes key recommendations for current and
future financial warfare. The Article begins with a general survey of the
modern financial infrastructure, the emerging battlefield of modern
warfare. Next, it provides a more detailed inventory of the financial
weapons of war. It accounts for traditional weapons like economic
sanctions, anti-money laundering regulations, and banking restrictions, as
well as cyber weapons like distributed denial-of-service attacks, data
manipulation hacks, and destructive intrusions. It also explains how these
weapons are used in current conflicts with Al Qaeda, Iran, {ISIS}, North
Korea, Russia, and Syria. The Article then contends with new tensions
relating to financial hostilities, cyberattacks, and non-state actors
posed by financial warfare for longstanding legal doctrines. Finally, it
recommends innovative cybersecurity incentives, advanced technological
stress tests, and comprehensive financial war games as three pragmatic
proposals that should be undertaken in response to modern financial
warfare while larger issues are still being deliberated by global
policymakers. Ultimately, this Article provides an early framework for
thinking and acting anew about modern financial warfare and the financial
weapons of war.},

In the context of a knowledge-based economy, this connection has taken on a structuring dimension. Thus, the purpose of this {TFSC} special issue is two-fold. On the one hand, we seek to explore the impacts of foresight on knowledge management and to understand its cognitive dimensions. And, on the other hand, we cast a future-oriented eye on knowledge management both as a set of practices and a research field.

Three cases of local implementation at farmer community level in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines illustrate how this approach was implemented. They are part of a global project in the field of food, agriculture and rural development, aiming at balancing the capacity to use the future, which is currently not fairly distributed to the detriment of local stakeholders, organizations and communities. Our results focus on the emergence of futures literacy as a capability, its connection to local agency and societal transformation. Our discussion highlights what in this approach makes the use of scenarios empowering, beyond its participatory features. The capacity to use the future has a great potential for local agency, even if it does not guarantee that communities will have the power or the willingness to directly engage in actions. Nevertheless, this approach seems to be a promising avenue for making everyone a future-literate potential agent of change.},

The methodology included the creation of a specific impact assessment framework and the assessment of certain foresight exercises ({FNR} Foresight and {eFORESEE} Malta) in terms of contribution to more participatory societies through case studies. The assessment showed that although contributing to more participatory societies was not among the main aims of the particular exercises, they managed to achieve certain impacts facilitating increased public participation or directly improving democratic processes in policy-making.

We adopt a systematic coding procedure of our empirical data drawn upon a longitudinal study of an entire {NPD} project as it unfolded in real time and in situ from its early stages through to its market commercialisation. Thus, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it extends previous foresight-sensemaking research by illuminating for the first time the role of sensefacilitating, a new cognitive mechanism that enhances the gradual development of new collective future-oriented mental models. Second, it answers the call for further investigation on the impact of foresight and sensemaking in {NPD} by showing that the cross-fertilization of foresight and sensemaking enables the collective discovery and formal diffusion of user foresights, which in turn inform the development of meaningful and novel brand worlds early in the {NPD} process.},

Based on empirical study of Taiwan, the future thinking of air pollution reduction should accept transmission from renewable energy between regions due to the cost effective and environmental benefits. The renewable energy and minor increase in non-renewable energy with better equipment will mitigate the emissions. The coal power will be the source of flexible scheduling at peak load. Interregional cooperation with seasonal power dispatching has become the future direction. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide suggestions when decision makers’ preference change. This study can serve as a decision support system for policymakers and a platform for stakeholders to discuss future visions on power planning.

As before, role-players in simulated interactions were students, and other students forecast using their judgement. Game theorists did better than previously. However, when the three new and five earlier conflicts are combined, 101 forecasts by 23 game theorists were no more accurate (31\%) than 354 forecasts by students who used unaided judgement (31\%). Experienced game theorists were not more accurate. Neither were those who spent more time on the task. Of 105 simulated-interaction forecasts, 62\% were accurate: an average error reduction of 47\% over game-theorist forecasts and a halving of error relative to the current method. Forecasts can sometimes have value without being strictly accurate. Assessing the usefulness of forecasts led to the same conclusions about the relative merits of the methods. Finally, by combining simulated interaction forecasts, accurate forecasts were obtained for seven of the eight situations.},

	abstract = {Rule learning is a popular branch of machine learning, which can provide accurate and interpretable classification results. In general, two main strategies of rule learning are referred to as ‘divide and conquer’ and ‘separate and conquer’. Decision tree generation that follows the former strategy has a serious drawback, which is known as the replicated sub-tree problem, resulting from the constraint that all branches of a decision tree must have one or more common attributes. The above problem is likely to result in high computational complexity and the risk of overfitting, which leads to the necessity to develop rule learning algorithms (e.g., Prism) that follow the separate and conquer strategy. The replicated sub-tree problem can be effectively solved using the Prism algorithm, but the trained models are still complex due to the need of training an independent rule set for each selected target class. In order to reduce the risk of overfitting and the model complexity, we propose in this paper a variant of the Prism algorithm referred to as {PrismCTC}. The experimental results show that the {PrismCTC} algorithm leads to advances in classification performance and reduction of model complexity, in comparison with the C4.5 and Prism algorithms.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper addresses a challenging topic, which in both academic and professional literatures has been widely discussed but mainly from one single angle – that is, how to select foresight methods. From that point of view researchers and consultants promote (even if unintentionally) the use of particular methods. Here the question of selection is raised from a different perspective: how are foresight methods selected? Design/methodology/approach – The guiding “theory” is that a better understanding of the fundamental attributes of foresight methods and their linkages to the core phases of a foresight process, together with the identification of possible patterns in the selection of methods, will provide useful insights as to how the selection of methods is carried out. Findings – So far the selection of foresight methods has been dominated by the intuition, insight, impulsiveness and – sometimes – inexperience or irresponsibility of practitioners and organisers. This paper reveals that the selection of foresight methods (even if not always coherent or systematic) is a multi‐factor process, and needs to be considered as such. Practical implications – The results can be utilised by lecturers and students to describe and understand better the use of foresight methods, and by organisers of foresight (including practitioners) to better inform decisions during the design of (hopefully) more coherent methodological frameworks. Originality/value – The paper combines practical concepts and frameworks (such as the Foresight Process and the Foresight Diamond) with innovative analyses to represent and visualise better the combination of methods in 886 case studies, for example introducing the Methods Combination Matrix ({MCM}) to examine the dynamics of a mix of methods.},

	abstract = {Prior studies of coopetition have explained the what, how and why of firms cooperating with competitors. Among these, examining the how question as to the stream of coopetition dynamics is the most challenging theme. Previous research has focused much more on the cooperation side. Less attention has been paid to the competition side to reveal what happens to competition after the competitors have collaborated. This study sheds light on the issue of cooperation-based competition by answering the question: while cooperating with competitors, how do rival partners compete based on cooperation? Linking the competitive dynamics perspective to coopetition, we conducted a single-case study to analyse the competition between two leading competitors in the Taiwanese bicycle industry. We collected the reported issues pertaining to the competition in the European market and supported by in-depth interviews. The analysis leads us to develop three propositions and a conceptual framework for illustrating the cooperation-based competition and addressing how cooperation may influence competition in a coopetition relationship. This study provides new insights into a theoretical issue of cooperation-based competition. The case also provides management implications while taking a coopetition strategy.},

	abstract = {To some, the advent of artificial intelligence ({AI}) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how {AI} systems, especially large language models ({LLMs}) that can be applied to many tasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of {LLMs} for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 214 national security experts designed to examine crisis escalation in a fictional U.S.-China scenario and compare the behavior of human player teams to {LLM}-simulated team responses in separate simulations. Here, we find that the {LLM}-simulated responses can be more aggressive and significantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable high-level agreement in the {LLM} and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in {LLMs} regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of {LLM}, and whether the {LLMs} are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The {LLM} simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath." When probing behavioral consistency across individual moves of the simulation, the tested {LLMs} deviated from each other but generally showed somewhat consistent behavior. Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following {AI}-based strategy recommendations.},

language generation, understanding, and few-shot learning in recent years.
An extensive body of work has explored how their performance may be
further improved through the tools of prompting, ranging from
verification, self-consistency, or intermediate scratchpads. In this
paper, we present a complementary approach to improve language responses
where multiple language model instances propose and debate their
individual responses and reasoning processes over multiple rounds to
arrive at a common final answer. Our findings indicate that this approach
significantly enhances mathematical and strategic reasoning across a
number of tasks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves the
factual validity of generated content, reducing fallacious answers and
hallucinations that contemporary models are prone to. Our approach may be
directly applied to existing black-box models and uses identical procedure
and prompts for all tasks we investigate. Overall, our findings suggest
that such "society of minds" approach has the potential to significantly
advance the capabilities of {LLMs} and pave the way for further
breakthroughs in language generation and understanding.},

We show that a dominated firm with the longer time-to-build can become a leader by making the investment earlier than a dominant firm with shorter investment lags. The leader’s capacity choice increases with the dominated firm’s time-to-build, even if the dominated entity is the leader. This finding is consistent with the observation in the electric vehicles market in which a relatively new firm with little experience of mass production makes aggressive investment early on, while the biggest carmakers capable of mass production are timing their investment. With a welfare-maximizing policy, however, the dominant firm with the shorter time-to-build always becomes the leader. There is a significant loss of social welfare with the dominated firm being the leader, and the loss increases with the asymmetry of time-to-build.},

	abstract = {In an effort to better understand the behavior of large language models ({LLM}), researchers recently turned to conducting psychological assessments on them. Several studies diagnose various psychological concepts in {LLMs}, such as psychopathological symptoms, personality traits, and intellectual functioning, aiming to unravel their black-box characteristics. But can we safely assess {LLMs} with tests that were originally designed for humans? The psychology domain looks back on decades of developing standards of appropriate testing procedures to ensure reliable and valid measures. We argue that analogous standardization processes are required for {LLM} assessments, given their differential functioning as compared to humans. In this paper, we propose seven requirements necessary for testing {LLMs}. Based on these, we critically reflect a sample of 25 recent machine psychology studies. Our analysis reveals (1) the lack of appropriate methods to assess test reliability and construct validity, (2) the unknown strength of construct-irrelevant influences, such as the contamination of pre-training corpora with test material, and (3) the pervasive issue of non-reproducibility of many studies. The results underscore the lack of a general methodology for the implementation of psychological assessments of {LLMs} and the need to redefine psychological constructs specifically for large language models rather than adopting them from human psychology.},

The latter scale was used for the first time in non-video-game players and showed good psychometric properties. Results showed several significant associations between personality and motivations for engaging in these games. People who played {MWGs} to socialize were high in openness and extraversion. Players high in agreeableness did not want to compete and did not emphasize winning as an important factor. People who played to escape from everyday problems reported high levels of neuroticism. Story-driven gamers described themselves as open and agreeable. Clearly, personality is relevant for predicting the attractiveness of {MWGs}, and the game has different aspects of attractiveness for different groups.

across a wide range of domains. However, in complex decision-making tasks,
pure {LLM}-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of
actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in
suboptimal performance. To develop strategic language agents, i.e., agents
that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making
abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers {LLM}-based agents with
reinforcement learning ({RL}). We consider Werewolf, a popular social
deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile
communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in
language actions, our agents use an {LLM} to perform deductive reasoning and
generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an {RL} policy trained to
optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates
to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome
the intrinsic bias and outperform existing {LLM}-based agents in the
Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our
agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic
play.},

We also find that {LLM} persuaders significantly increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers.

The paper draws on the author's observations of thousands of managers in those war games, on his familiarity with simulation technologies, and on research in social psychology, to categorize and recommend war‐gaming techniques for different business needs. The paper includes two illustrative case descriptions. Findings – The paper finds that business war game objectives include: stimulating excitement around a strategy; building skill on strategic thinking; creating strategy options and anticipating threats and opportunities; and testing strategy options and making decisions. When the war‐game objective calls for quantitative models, traditional financial or trend‐line analysis can be dangerous. The objective will also influence the scope and length of the game, and its “rules of engagement.” Originality/value – Few managers have participated in a business war game, and even fewer are aware of the variety of war games. This paper describes the link between war gaming and competitive advantage, and helps managers (and those who advise them) know why, when, and how to use different types of business war games.},

	abstract = {Knights and knaves problems represent a classic genre of logical puzzles where characters either tell the truth or lie. The objective is to logically deduce each character's identity based on their statements. The challenge arises from the truth-telling or lying behavior, which influences the logical implications of each statement. Solving these puzzles requires not only direct deductions from individual statements, but the ability to assess the truthfulness of statements by reasoning through various hypothetical scenarios. As such, knights and knaves puzzles serve as compelling examples of suppositional reasoning. In this paper, we introduce \${\textbackslash}textit\{{TruthQuest}\}\$, a benchmark for suppositional reasoning based on the principles of knights and knaves puzzles. Our benchmark presents problems of varying complexity, considering both the number of characters and the types of logical statements involved. Evaluations on \${\textbackslash}textit\{{TruthQuest}\}\$ show that large language models like Llama 3 and Mixtral-8x7B exhibit significant difficulties solving these tasks. A detailed error analysis of the models' output reveals that lower-performing models exhibit a diverse range of reasoning errors, frequently failing to grasp the concept of truth and lies. In comparison, more proficient models primarily struggle with accurately inferring the logical implications of potentially false statements.},

been employed previously by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation ({DSTO}) in
Australia for interagency harbour security and force protection exercises, and was seen to be
particularly effective for handling problems in complex environments with diverse
stakeholders. For this reason, it was decided to transfer the methodology to Canada for use in
marine security planning for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (V2010).
Overall, the experience of organizing and running Matrix Games to support Olympic marine
security planners proved to be very effective at helping the marine security agencies organize
their planning, and uncover gaps and issues in their plans, and to gain mutual understanding
of their respective capabilities and mandates. Over the course of the three Matrix Games,
many refinements and adjustments were made to the methodology to adapt it to Canadian
needs, to address specific planning goals, to adjust to evolving participation levels and
complexity, to improve data capture and reporting, incorporate lessons learned, and improve
overall effectiveness and efficiency.
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the Matrix Game methodology, including
refinements, to discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and to provide recommendations for its
effective use.},

We first propose a composite scenario tree that captures both types of uncertainty, and we exploit its unique structure to derive new theoretical properties that can drastically reduce the number of non-anticipativity constraints ({NACs}). Since the reduced model is often still intractable, we discuss two special solution approaches. The first is a sequential scenario decomposition heuristic in which we sequentially solve endogenous {MILP} subproblems to determine the binary investment decisions, fix these decisions to satisfy the first-period and exogenous {NACs}, and then solve the resulting model to obtain a feasible solution. The second is Lagrangean decomposition. We present numerical results for a process network and an oilfield development planning problem. The results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the special solution methods over solving the reduced model directly.},

We construct these layers building on earlier literature and illustrate them with a case example from the region of Antofagasta in Chile. We argue that foresight exercises benefit from considering multiple levels and respective different emphases in analysis. For instance, on the landscape layer the focus tends to be on contributions to knowledge while on the organisational layer it is more on capabilities. The layers help position the foresight exercise and its effects in relation to the broader context. Thus, we expect the concept of multi-layered foresight to support the design, management and evaluation of foresight.},

	abstract = {The overwhelming success of {GPT}-4 in early 2023 highlighted the
transformative potential of large language models ({LLMs}) across various
sectors, including national security. This article explores the
implications of {LLM} integration within national security contexts,
analyzing their potential to revolutionize information processing,
decision-making, and operational efficiency. Whereas {LLMs} offer
substantial benefits, such as automating tasks and enhancing data
analysis, they also pose significant risks, including hallucinations, data
privacy concerns, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Through their
coupling with decision-theoretic principles and Bayesian reasoning, {LLMs}
can significantly improve decision-making processes within national
security organizations. Namely, {LLMs} can facilitate the transition from
data to actionable decisions, enabling decision-makers to quickly receive
and distill available information with less manpower. Current applications
within the {US} Department of Defense and beyond are explored, e.g., the
{USAF}'s use of {LLMs} for wargaming and automatic summarization, that
illustrate their potential to streamline operations and support
decision-making. However, these applications necessitate rigorous
safeguards to ensure accuracy and reliability. The broader implications of
{LLM} integration extend to strategic planning, international relations, and
the broader geopolitical landscape, with adversarial nations leveraging
{LLMs} for disinformation and cyber operations, emphasizing the need for
robust countermeasures. Despite exhibiting "sparks" of artificial general
intelligence, {LLMs} are best suited for supporting roles rather than
leading strategic decisions. Their use in training and wargaming can
provide valuable insights and personalized learning experiences for
military personnel, thereby improving operational readiness.},

That preparedness consists of warehouse location and capacity assignment and the procurement of commodities on the one hand and refurbishing the rescue network infrastructure on the other. Two types of uncertainty are considered: exogenous uncertainty which is due to the lack of full knowledge about the probability and intensity of the disaster for each focal point in a given network; and endogenous uncertainty which is based on the decision-maker’s investment to obtain greater accuracy in regard to the occurrence of the disaster and to reinforcing the network infrastructure. A stochastic mixed 0-1 bilinear optimization model is presented. Additionally, a time-consistent stochastic dominance-based risk-averse measure for a set of profiles in a multifunction setting is introduced. Both types of elements imply large-sized problems, so some kind of decomposition algorithmic should be used. Based on the special features of the three-stage problem subject of this work, we introduce the Cluster Dual Descent Algorithm for obtaining feasible solutions based on duality theory. Computational results are reported for a well-known real-life case by comparing the performance of the models based on the alternatives given by the risk-neutral and risk-averse versions jointly with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty.},

We consider the development of these practices and find that they have a substantially entangled and overlapping history, particularly at the {RAND} Corporation in the 1950s. Despite shared historical roots, the treatment of war gaming and scenario planning in the scholarly literature branched out into different streams. This separation is unfortunate because it obscures a better understanding of the premises under which these practices are effective. We propose an analysis of the overlaps and contrasts of war gaming and scenario planning that sets out clear boundary conditions for their use and efficacy. We find that each practice is tailored to provide strategic guidance in a context where the organization is facing different forms of uncertainty. This suggests they may be effective, and thus improve organizational performance, where the relevant uncertainties are operative. Such benefits would be apparent over longer time scales, and only if the relevant boundary conditions are met. However, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal empirical test of either war gaming or scenario planning is available. We therefore conclude that more research is needed to ascertain the true relationship between these popular practices and their performance outcomes.},

However, the literature has lacked insight into how competitive advantage emerges under such conditions, and which contingencies affect the coopetition-performance relationship. In the context of new product development, this study (a) assesses whether organizational learning translates coopetition among functional units into firm performance, and (b) investigates the moderating role of power sharing. Based on survey data from 331 German companies in various industries, our findings confirm that organizational learning mediates the association between cross-functional coopetition and firm performance. In addition, the results show that power sharing moderates the relationship between cross-functional coopetition and organizational learning. This study extends the limited literature on cross-functional coopetition, and contributes to the current debate on whether intra-firm competition constrains or promotes learning in new product development.},

We consider studying the behavior of {LLM}-based agents which we refer to as {LLM} personas and present a case study with {GPT}-3.5 and {GPT}-4 to investigate whether {LLMs} can generate content that aligns with their assigned personality profiles. To this end, we simulate distinct {LLM} personas based on the Big Five personality model, have them complete the 44-item Big Five Inventory ({BFI}) personality test and a story writing task, and then assess their essays with automatic and human evaluations. Results show that {LLM} personas' self-reported {BFI} scores are consistent with their designated personality types, with large effect sizes observed across five traits. Additionally, {LLM} personas' writings have emerging representative linguistic patterns for personality traits when compared with a human writing corpus. Furthermore, human evaluation shows that humans can perceive some personality traits with an accuracy of up to 80\%. Interestingly, the accuracy drops significantly when the annotators were informed of {AI} authorship.},

	shorttitle = {Persuasion Should be Double-Blind},
	abstract = {Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing various domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with real-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations. For instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee explicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ, with each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for the persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the "Double Blind" condition, where critical information is fully shared between participants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as the mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the persuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's mental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that align with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce {ToMMA}, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by causal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains undisclosed between agents, preserving "double-blind" conditions, while causal {ToM} directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like persuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present {CToMPersu}, a multi-domain, multi-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and logical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues. Our dataset and prompts are available at https://github.com/{DingyiZhang}/{ToMMA}-{CToMPersu} .},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and predict the mental states of oneself and others, known as the Theory of Mind ({ToM}), is crucial for effective social scenarios. Although recent studies have evaluated {ToM} in Large Language Models ({LLMs}), existing benchmarks focus on simplified settings (e.g., Sally-Anne-style tasks) and overlook the complexity of real-world social interactions. To mitigate this gap, we propose {PersuasiveToM}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the {ToM} abilities of {LLMs} in persuasive dialogues. Our framework contains two core tasks: {ToM} Reasoning, which tests tracking of evolving desires, beliefs, and intentions; and {ToM} Application, which assesses the use of inferred mental states to predict and evaluate persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight leading {LLMs} reveal that while models excel on multiple questions, they struggle with the tasks that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of mental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue comprehensively. Our aim with {PersuasiveToM} is to allow an effective evaluation of the {ToM} reasoning ability of {LLMs} with more focus on complex psychological activities.

	abstract = {The rich and complex outcomes of foresight activities are often difficult to translate into policy relevant intelligence. The struggle in connecting futures intelligence to policy making can be read as a basic challenge in foresight: working on futures intelligence has emerged as a way to improve policy, but once it is delegated to professional foresight practitioners with attendant quality and quality control, however, it also introduces a distance to policy making. Whilst independence and methodological rigour is desirable for high quality futures intelligence, bridging this intelligence with the policy context is essential for its use. Experiencing this challenge during a scenario exercise on the future European research and innovation system, the authors of this paper embarked on an experiment to go beyond evaluating the robustness of the scenarios, produced in a foresight exercise, by developing and applying “policy lenses” to translate the scenarios into policy tailored intelligence. This paper describes the experiment, which saw the development and application of three types of policy lenses: (1) a lens based on the layered processes of European policy making, (2) a lens based on three research and innovation policy priorities and (3) a lens on alternative geo-political situations of the European continent. The paper describes the logic behind the lenses, the interpretation of the original scenarios when viewed through these lenses, and then concludes by reflecting on how such an experiment could be generalised to other settings of policy-oriented foresight.},

	abstract = {The recent surge in high-quality open-source Generative {AI} text models (colloquially: {LLMs}), as well as efficient finetuning techniques, have opened the possibility of creating high-quality personalized models that generate text attuned to a specific individual's needs and are capable of credibly imitating their writing style by refining an open-source model with that person's own data. The technology to create such models is accessible to private individuals, and training and running such models can be done cheaply on consumer-grade hardware. While these advancements are a huge gain for usability and privacy, this position paper argues that the practical feasibility of impersonating specific individuals also introduces novel safety risks. For instance, this technology enables the creation of phishing emails or fraudulent social media accounts, based on small amounts of publicly available text, or by the individuals themselves to escape {AI} text detection. We further argue that these risks are complementary to - and distinct from - the much-discussed risks of other impersonation attacks such as image, voice, or video deepfakes, and are not adequately addressed by the larger research community, or the current generation of open- and closed-source models.},

Its broad adoption and sustained use over 50years have taken it beyond the typical management fashion or fad. It has helped shape the strategies of many types of institutions and organisations. The process encourages individuals to recall past events and to imagine future happenings. But, little is known about neither how they do this nor the contextual conditions that shape how they do it and how they might do it better. Recent developments in cognitive psychology and neuroscience have had success in several management domains e.g., marketing, information systems, leadership, economics and finance. However, little attention has been paid to their application in strategic management and, in particular, in scenario planning. The paper provides a critical coverage of the pertinent cognitive sciences literature and explores opportunities for co-joint research between scenario planners and cognitive psychologists that might help to further foster and support the {IL} process.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, {CoT}). However, {LLMs} can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that {LLMs} lack an internal \${\textbackslash}textit\{world model\}\$ to predict the world \${\textbackslash}textit\{state\}\$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents {LLMs} from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new {LLM} reasoning framework,
\${\textbackslash}underline\{R\}\$easoning vi\${\textbackslash}underline\{a\}\$ \${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$lanning \${\textbackslash}textbf\{({RAP})\}\$. {RAP} repurposes the {LLM} as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the {LLM} (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the {LLM} (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration \${\textbackslash}textit\{vs.\}\$ exploitation. We apply {RAP} to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of {RAP} over various strong baselines, including {CoT} and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. {RAP} on {LLAMA}-33B surpasses {CoT} on {GPT}-4 with 33\% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.},

assessments. But no one has ever actually tested whether decomposition is
adding or subtracting noise from the analytic process?and there are good
reasons for suspecting that decomposition will, on balance, degrade the

	abstract = {In this unprecedented era of technology-driven transformation, it becomes more critical than ever that we aggressively invest in developing robust artificial intelligence ({AI}) for wargaming in support of decision-making. By advancing {AI}-enabled systems and pairing these with human judgment, we will be able to enhance all-domain awareness, improve the speed and quality of our decision cycles, offer recommendations for novel courses of action, and more rapidly counter our adversary's actions. It therefore becomes imperative that we accelerate the development of {AI} to help us better address the complexity of modern challenges and dilemmas that currently requires human intelligence and, if possible, attempt to surpass human intelligence--not to replace humans, but to augment and better inform human decision-making at machine speed. Although deep reinforcement learning continues to show promising results in intelligent agent behavior development for the long-horizon, complex tasks typically found in combat modeling and simulation, further research is needed to enable the scaling of {AI} to deal with these intricate and expansive state-spaces characteristic of wargaming for either concept development, education, or analysis. To help address this challenge, in our research, we are developing and implementing a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that includes a multi-model approach and dimension-invariant observation abstractions.},

	abstract = {Background
During a catastrophe, health-care providers may face difficult questions regarding who will receive limited life-saving resources. The ethical principles that should guide decision-making have been considered by expert panels but have not been well explored with the public or front-line clinicians. The objective of this study was to characterize the public’s values regarding how scarce mechanical ventilators should be allocated during an influenza pandemic, with the ultimate goal of informing a statewide scare resource allocation framework.
Methods
Adopting deliberative democracy practices, we conducted 15 half-day community engagement forums with the general public and health-related professionals. Small group discussions of six potential guiding ethical principles were led by trained facilitators. The forums consisted exclusively of either members of the general public or health-related or disaster response professionals and were convened in a variety of meeting places across the state of Maryland. Primary data sources were predeliberation and postdeliberation surveys and the notes from small group deliberations compiled by trained note takers.
Results
Three hundred twenty-four individuals participated in 15 forums. Participants indicated a preference for prioritizing short-term and long-term survival, but they indicated that these should not be the only factors driving decision-making during a crisis. Qualitative analysis identified 10 major themes that emerged. Many, but not all, themes were consistent with previously issued recommendations. The most important difference related to withholding vs withdrawing ventilator support.
Conclusions
The values expressed by the public and front-line clinicians sometimes diverge from expert guidance in important ways. Awareness of these differences should inform policy making.},

Use of particular foresight tools can have predictable effects on strategy making – providing positive changes in mental models and challenging business-as-usual approaches but, more negatively, can also serve to narrow and shape managers’ anticipations of the future. Any scenario activity necessarily involves simplification and evaluation processes in knowledge elicitation that need to be carefully monitored for effectiveness. In addition, historical analysis of the focal industry's use of “recipes” can give the scenario practitioner insights into the nature of unfolding futures. Inside the scenario development process, verbal and visual analysis of face-to-face interactions within the scenario team can give insights into process issues and difficulties, and an organisation's prior involvement with scenario activity may give insights into the likely time-demands of any planned activities. Additionally, stakeholders from different organisations can be facilitated to work effectively together in foresight activities. Such facilitated activities can be used to both develop policy and achieve commonly-held objectives. Two papers provide new guidance on the form of successful Delphi applications. Finally, typologies of both foresight methods/approaches and of intervention practices will allow the reflective practitioner to more fully appreciate the characteristics – both positive and negative – of a particular method and/or intervention type.},

It concludes that the threshold level for risk proneness of utility functions and the degree of exposure/vulnerability are key factors to consider in choosing robustness measures and scenarios.

Scenario planning in the government not only tends to be focused on issues of higher complexity and significance to public policy, but also in comparison to people in the private business, public officials have fundamental psychological and institutional constraints in their scenario thinking. These constraints make it difficult for them to contemplate multiple ‘untidy’ futures and imagine the possibility of policy failure: skills which are essential for successful scenario projects. Based on specific characteristics of scenario planning in the Japanese government, this paper contributes on better understanding the challenges and strategic solutions in providing more successful scenario planning in the public sector. Specifically, this paper argues that possible solutions in overcoming these constraints may be to shake public bureaucrats out of their thinking by providing free and open venues of conversation and more importantly through ‘derailment’ exercises.},

Drawing on behavioural strategy as a theoretical lens, we design a yardstick to study the impact of scenario-based strategizing. We then describe our approach, which includes developing scenarios and alternative strategies separately and supporting the strategy selection through an integrated assessment of the goal-based efficacy and robustness. To facilitate the collaborative strategizing in teams, we propose a matrix with robustness and efficacy as the two axes, which we call the Parmenides Matrix. We assess the impact of the novel approach by applying it in two cases, at a governmental agency (German Environmental Ministry) and a firm affected by disruptive change (Bosch, leading global supplier of technology and solutions).},

Technological uncertainty is reflected in the random arrival of innovations, and policy uncertainty in the likely provision or retraction of a subsidy that takes the form of a fixed premium on top of the electricity price. We show that greater likelihood of subsidy retraction (provision) lowers (raises) the incentive to invest, and, by comparing a stepwise to a lumpy investment strategy, we show how an embedded option to adopt an improved technology version mitigates the impact of subsidy retraction on investment timing. Specifically, we show how stepwise investment facilitates earlier technology adoption compared to lumpy investment, and that, under stepwise investment, technological uncertainty accelerates technology adoption, thus further offsetting the incentive to delay investment in the light of subsidy retraction.},

By frames, we mean the interpretive structures that underlie foresight actors’ work. The six foresight frames are the predictive, planning, scenaric, visionary, critical and transformative frames. The frames may be used to position phases of foresight, individual processes or, most usefully, interlinked foresight processes in a system. We develop the model based on futures literature and elaborate it in a study of comprehensive security foresight in Finland conducted during the Strategic Research Council project “From Failand to Winland”. Moreover, we test our typology with four additional foresight system cases: Singapore, United Kingdom, Wallonia and Russia. The six frames capture different sets of assumptions and different types of foresight which can be distributed to different actors in a foresight system. Thus we suggest that diversity of foresight frames is likely to be an element of successful foresight systems.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12349},
	abstract = {Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of
intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated
than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math
problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning,
Interaction, and Negotiation ({SPIN}-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation
designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social
reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or
single-agent reasoning, {SPIN}-Bench combines classical {PDDL} tasks,
competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent
negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes
both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety
of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of {AI} agents.
We formulate the benchmark {SPIN}-Bench by systematically varying action
spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate
a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical
and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other
(adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that
while contemporary {LLMs} handle basic fact retrieval and short-range
planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance
bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state
spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision
{SPIN}-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent
planning, social reasoning, and human--{AI} teaming. Project Website:

	abstract = {Intelligence work is in some ways like a newspaper or newsmagazine, in
some like a business, in some like the research activity of a university;
very little of it involves cloaks and daggers. All of it is important to
national survival, and should be understood by the citizens of a
democracy.In this remarkable book, an able scholar, experienced in foreign
intelligence, analyzes all of these varied aspects of what is known as
"high-level foreign positive intelligence." Illustrations are drawn from
that branch, but the lessons apply to all intelligence, and in fact to all
those phases of business, of journalism, and (most importantly) of
scholarship, where the problem is to learn what has happened or will
happen.Originally published in 1966.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the
latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously
out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University

	abstract = {Strategic reasoning enables agents to cooperate, communicate, and compete
with other agents in diverse situations. Existing approaches to solving
strategic games rely on extensive training, yielding strategies that do
not generalize to new scenarios or games without retraining. Large
Language Models ({LLMs}), with their ability to comprehend and generate
complex, context-rich language, could prove powerful as tools for
strategic gameplay. This paper introduces an approach that uses pretrained
{LLMs} with few-shot chain-of-thought examples to enable strategic reasoning
for {AI} agents. Our approach uses systematically generated demonstrations
of reasoning about states, values, and beliefs to prompt the model. Using
extensive variations of simple matrix games, we show that strategies that
are derived based on systematically generated prompts generalize almost
perfectly to new game structures, alternate objectives, and hidden
information. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach can lead to
human-like negotiation strategies in realistic scenarios without any extra
training or fine-tuning. Our results highlight the ability of {LLMs}, guided
by systematic reasoning demonstrations, to adapt and excel in diverse
strategic scenarios.},

	abstract = {Since the end of the 1980s – the Decade of Style (Mort, 1996) – the value of style in design has fallen. Recent times (Whicher et al., 2015) see a focus on style as a sign of design’s immaturity, while a more mature design should be attending to process, strategy and policy creation. Design Thinking has been enjoying its success in the same spirit, where it is championed (Martin, 2009, Neumeier, 2009 Martin, 2009, Neumeier, 2009) as a way of taking design away from its early stage as ‘mere’ styling, towards the more thoughtful, serious matters of business. The philosopher Gilles Deleuze is of a different mind however. ‘Style,’ he writes Deleuze (1995, p.31), ‘amounts to innovation.’ For us this engages not only a rethinking of design practice in particular, but also a reconsideration of the guiding principles of scenario planning. Deleuze’s thought entails the opportunity for styling to be an act that participates in driving all creativity towards making a successful future impact (Flynn and Chatman, 2004, Cox, 2005). A philosophical disruption of current design and scenarios orthodoxies offers a way of considering that style has a key role in the production of the future. Here, then, we will investigate the creative, even innovative, opportunities that emerge from a reworking of the value of style that comes from a critique of Design Thinking, a perspective on future-thinking (especially scenario planning (e.g. Schwartz, 1991, Li, 2014, Ramírez and Selin, 2014), but also some work from organisation and management studies (e.g. Tsoukas, 2005, 2015)), and an encounter with philosophy (particularly the work of Deleuze and Guattari, 1984, Deleuze and Guattari, 1987, Deleuze and Guattari, 1994. We will highlight the affective capacities of style – in design and scenarios, both as creative constructing of futures – by way of creatively accessing uncertainty, complexity and indeterminacy in the production of strategic maps for living (both individuals and organisations).},

Under resource-based theory and the relational view, this current study evaluates whether competitive intensity and competitive aggressiveness negatively moderate the coopetition-financial performance relationship. Through a mixed methods approach featuring New Zealand wine producers, a positive relationship existed between coopetition and financial performance supporting earlier research. However, competitive aggressiveness provided a negative moderation effect and competitive intensity had a positive moderation effect. Unique insights emerge regarding underlying issues (potential dark-sides) behind the coopetition-financial performance relationship. Competitive intensity provides an opportunity for owner-managers to select trustworthy rivals targeting complementary product-markets. However, if decision-makers cannot effectively manage competitive aggressiveness across product-market strategies, they are likely to experience certain harmful outcomes, like tensions and diluted competitive advantages.},

The countries have been often associated with a high threat of terrorism thus increasing risk for various stakeholders. To analyse the potential ways these threats might unfold in the future, four scenarios of possible terrorism against China are put forward. In each scenario, various levels of Chinese economic engagement interact with local regimes which in turn leads to differing containments of potential terrorist threats. A preferable scenario “United Front’’ is identified for its low risk for Chinese interest in the region and its success of economic strategy implemented by China. However, this preferable scenario (for China) calls into question how China can achieve its high influence in the region through investment without perpetuating a state of surveillance model that might not be conducive to peace on the long run. Therefore, we provide preliminary policy guidelines to achieve China’s original diplomatic and economic aims while decreasing the likelihood of terrorism without incurring in possible humanitarian losses in the region.},

	title = {The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity},
	abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models ({LRMs}) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how {LRMs} “think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier {LRMs} face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing {LRMs} with their standard {LLM} counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) lowcomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform {LRMs}, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in {LRMs} demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that {LRMs} have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a comprehensive research program for determining the epistemological foundations of analytic wargaming. Wargaming has been used in military, government, and private sectors for decades, with tens of millions of dollars spent annually on it. In light of the changing strategic circumstances of the twenty-first century, it has only become more popular. However, the epistemological foundations of the method are poorly understood. Many professional wargamers contend that wargaming is an “art” and thus unable to be systemically evaluated. Recent work by a small coterie of international relations scholars has contended that wargaming can be reconciled with social science, typically by evaluating wargaming according to experimental standards. However, this solution strips wargames of most of their unique features and cannot explain why some of the most prominent wargames in history produced meaningful results. In this paper, I argue that in the attempt to better understand wargaming’s epistemology, scholars should begin by recognizing the prominent features of wargames and research each of these to determine if and how wargames produce rigorous knowledge. In making this argument, I identify five distinct “methodological machineries” of wargaming—the recurring processes through which wargames may produce knowledge—that distinguish wargaming from other social science methods: (i) they are representative, (ii) they feature consequential decisions made by human players, (iii) they are adjudicated, (iv) they are immersive, and (v) they are bespoke designs. I show how each of these machineries offers potential opportunities and dangers in the production of knowledge through the method of wargaming. In outlining these distinct features, I offer a clear and viable research program for epistemologists of wargaming.},

	abstract = {Strategic foresight is a scientific field in rapid development judged from the increase in number of yearly publications the last decade. What characterizes the research in this field? To answer this question we undertook a systematic literature review searching two library databases, Business Source Complete and {ScienceDirect}, for scientific articles related to the topic ´strategic foresight´ in the context of the organization. The search revealed 59 publications published between January 2000 and October 2014. The articles were systematically organized and analyzed. This review provides the status of this emergent research field. Although we witness a growth of academic interest in strategic foresight, we argue that this scientific field is weakly organized and there is a lack of theoretical progress. We have analyzed the research subjects addressed in the 59 articles, and from this a taxonomy of eight categories. Three categories dominate in terms of frequency of articles: methods applied, organizing practices, and experiences gained. There is only limited research on motivation and use, value contribution, and innovation. Explorative research dominates, and a variety of theoretical perspectives has been used. Some attempts to build conceptual foundations can be observed, but in general, we found no single perspective that deserves loyalty on which a coherent theoretical foundation of strategic foresight is built. Strategic foresight has a great potential of contributing more to the success of a firm if the research moves from today's dominating explorative research to also include more explanatory research.},

This is reflected in the fact that literature reveals an abundance of different and at times contradictory definitions, characteristics, principles and methodological ideas about scenarios. It has been suggested that a pressing need for the future of scenarios is amongst other things, to resolve the confusion over ‘the definitions and methods of scenarios’. This paper makes a beginning at this need by tracing the origins and growth of scenarios and the subsequent evolution of the various methodologies; a classification of the methodologies into three main schools of techniques is given and the salient features of these schools are compared and contrasted.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2502.06060},
	abstract = {Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings, as it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable settings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and speaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, we improve a model's listening skills by training them to predict information about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously improve a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent behaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard {RL}.

	title = {Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601},
	abstract = {Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem
solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to
token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference.
This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration,
strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To
surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model
inference, Tree of Thoughts ({ToT}), which generalizes over the popular
Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables
exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as
intermediate steps toward problem solving. {ToT} allows {LMs} to perform
deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning
paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as
well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global
choices. Our experiments show that {ToT} significantly enhances language
models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring
non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini
Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while {GPT}-4 with chain-of-thought
prompting only solved 4\% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of
74\%. Code repo with all prompts:

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method that was developed for analyzing the strategic foresight process of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense. In 2013–2014, experts of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense applied a strategic foresight method to identify potential threats and opportunities for 2015–2030 period. This work led them to anticipate the broad trends that lead to the European migration crisis and a more confrontative Russian foreign policy. However, in retrospect the methods used were not specific enough about the time frame of these potential outcomes, nor did the Hungarian analysts believe their findings strongly enough. These results generated a lively debate among Hungarian defense experts about how the foresight method could be improved. This paper contributes to this effort by introducing a three-step diagnostic method for foresight processes that applies different analytical frameworks developed in the foresight literature. The first step leverages Voros’ foresight framework, the second step utilizes Rafael Popper's categories of analysis, and step three evaluates the root causes of problems experienced in the foresight study. The paper concludes that the Hungarian foresight process was a so-called “shallow” foresight exercise because the organizational mindset of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense oriented the analysts narrowly towards intelligence methods.},

	abstract = {Although the value of portfolios of real options is often affected by both exogenous and endogenous sources of uncertainty, most existing valuation approaches consider only the former and neglect the latter. In this paper, we introduce an approach for valuing portfolios of interdependent real options under both types of uncertainty. In particular, we study a large portfolio of options (deferment, staging, mothballing, abandonment) under conditions of four underlying uncertainties. Two of the uncertainties, decision-dependent cost to completion and state-dependent salvage value, are endogenous, the other two, operating revenues and their growth rate, are exogenous. Assuming that endogenous uncertainties can be exogenised, we formulate the valuation problem as a discrete stochastic dynamic program. To approximate the value of this optimisation problem, we apply a simulation-and-regression-based approach and present an efficient valuation algorithm. The key feature of our algorithm is that it exploits the problem structure to explicitly account for reachability – that is the sample paths in which resource states can be reached. The applicability of the approach is illustrated by valuing an urban infrastructure investment. We conduct a reachability analysis and show that the presence of the decision-dependent uncertainty has adverse computational effects as it increases algorithmic complexity and reduces simulation efficiency. We investigate the way in which the value of the portfolio and its individual options are affected by the initial operating revenues, and by the degrees of exogenous and endogenous uncertainty. The results demonstrate that ignoring endogenous, decision- and state-dependent uncertainty can lead to substantial over- and under-valuation, respectively.},

Also, content analysis and survey methods were respectively employed to identify different discourses related to cultural industries and select the discourse governing the desired status of cultural industries. Library research and questionnaire are used as tools for data collection. The results show that the discourse governing the desired status of cultural industries is an "economic" discourse, and also three scenarios can be imagined based on "cultural", "social" and " political" discourses for the future of Iran’s cultural industries.},

I unpack the underlying mechanisms influencing escalation decisions involving drones by proposing a logic of remote-controlled restraint: drones limit escalation in ways not possible when inhabited assets are used. To test this logic and explore its instrumental and emotional microfoundations, I field "comparative wargames." I immerse national security professionals in crisis scenarios that vary whether a drone or inhabited aircraft is shot down. I validate wargame findings using a survey experiment. The wargames shed light on the microfoundations of escalation, highlight limits of existing theories, and demonstrate the utility of comparative wargaming as an {IR} research tool.},

	abstract = {Background. Wargaming has a long history as a tool for understanding the complexity of conflict. Although wargames have shown their relevance across topics and time, the immersive nature of wargames and the guild-like communities that surround them have often resisted the social scientific advances that occurred alongside the evolution of warfare. However, recent work raises new possibilities for integrating wargaming practices and social scientific methods.
Purpose. Develop the experimental wargaming method and practice. Prioritizing the focus on iteration, control, and generalizability within experimental design can provide new opportunities for wargames to answer broader questions about decision-making, crisis behaviors, and patterns of outcomes.
Method. The International Crisis Wargame developed in 2018 demonstrates the viability of experimental wargaming, and models the process of theorizing, designing, developing, and executing these wargames. It also identifies what makes games more or less experimental and details how experimental design influenced choices in the game.
Conclusion. Experimental wargames are a promising new tool for both the social science and the wargaming communities. A proposed new research agenda for experimental design within wargames would support this nascent method},

Either by fielding original games or by leveraging archival wargame materials, researchers can study rare events or topics where evidence is difficult to observe. However, scholars have little guidance on how to apply this novel methodological approach to political science research. This article evaluates how political scientists can use wargames as a method of scholarly inquiry and sets out to establish a research agenda for wargaming in International Relations. We first differentiate wargames from other methodological approaches and highlight their ecological validity. We then chart out how researchers can build and run their own games or draw from archival wargames for theory development and testing. In doing so, we explain how researchers can navigate issues of recruitment, bias, validity, and generalizability when using wargames for research, and identify ways to evaluate the potential benefits and pitfalls of wargames as a tool of inquiry. We argue that wargames offer unique opportunities for political scientists to study decision-making processes both in and beyond the International Relations subfield.},

	abstract = {The Western Approaches Tactical Unit ({WATU}) was a Royal Navy analysis team founded in early 1942. Their remit was to study the conduct of convoy operations, to understand how the U-boats operated and to formulate tactics to counter this evolving threat. The unit was made up of experienced naval officers and a number of talented young women from the {WRNS}. Using conceptual/analytical wargames, {WATU} developed a range of tactics during the war and disseminated these to over 5,000 Allied officers through a series of lectures and tactical games. Many of these appeared in the Atlantic Convoy Instructions and were used with considerable success by Allied naval forces during the decisive engagements of the Atlantic War. The essay outlines the origins and purpose of the organisation, how the team functioned, the individuals that conducted the wargames, and the series of evolving challenges that it was intended to overcome – focusing on the series of Anti-Submarine Warfare training and analysis wargames conducted by the unit between 1942 and 1943. The article concludes with an overview of some of the numerous lessons that modern defence analysts could draw from the work of the unit and highlights its utility as an exemplar of the use of wargaming as a tool for modern defence analysis.},

Traditional multi-view learning approaches always encounter small-scale label-known multi-view instances problem and insufficient discriminant information problem. Although some label-unknown multi-view data set generation approaches are developed to enhance useful discriminant information, the weights of views and features are not considered. This paper proposes a weight-based label-unknown multi-view data set generation approach ({WLM}) to overcome such a disadvantage. The procedure of {WLM} consists of three main steps. First, get the weights of views and features. Second, get similar instances of each label-known instance. Third, generate and select feasible label-unknown instances which are applied to multi-view learning approaches along with the original label-known multi-view instances. Further, comparisons and analysis about classification performance, clustering performance, bipartite ranking performance, image retrieval performance, significance on some multi-view data sets with some multi-view learning approaches validate the usefulness of {WLM}.},
