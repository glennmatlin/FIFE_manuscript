[2025-09-09 00:35] Initial repository inventory and reading

Context: Prepare a detailed editorial methodology by reading the manuscript, bibliography, and related assets in the `wopr` folder.

Action: Listed directory contents; opened `main.typ` to map section structure and content; skimmed `zotero.bib` for key entries (Hogan & Brennen 2024, FAIR Diplomacy 2022, Lamparth 2024, Rivera et al. 2024); inspected `wargames_survey_0019_09_09.csv` headers and sample rows to understand available survey fields.

Result: Confirmed manuscript sections exist with placeholders and TODOs; bibliography contains major LLM wargaming items except "Shrivastava 2024" (not found); figures/tables include typed scaffolds and `creativity_quadrants.png`; found CSV/XLSX survey data aligned to the analytical/creative axes. Proceeding to produce the requested methodology.

[2025-09-09 00:41] Added memory and methodology plan docs

Context: Persist the methodology plan and set up a shared memory document for iterative work per user request.

Action: Created `MEMORY.md` with style/tone, terminology, citation, reproducibility invariants, open questions, pending tasks, and a decision log template. Added `METHODOLOGY_PLAN.md` capturing the full section-by-section methodology plan. Did not modify existing manuscript content.

Result: Memory document and methodology plan are present at repository root for ongoing coordination. Ready to use in subsequent edit cycles.

[2025-09-09 16:55] Read main.typ and context files

Context: Understand manuscript content, tone, placeholders, and prior decisions to prepare targeted edits.

Action: Listed files in `wopr`; read `MEMORY.md`, `METHODOLOGY_PLAN.md`; read `main.typ` in full (739 lines) in three chunks; noted sections, TODOs, missing values (`#num_papers`), citation placeholders, and caption metadata gaps.

Result: Established an edit inventory: abstract and introduction need rewrite and safety hook; Methods requires PRISMA counts, queries, and windows; Related Works needs citations; Q4 section has brainstorming and unverified claims; figures/tables need source, N, and date; one missing bib entry (Shrivastava 2024). Ready to draft concrete revisions.

[2025-09-09 17:10] Broader edit pass: LM terminology, PRISMA removal, anonymity

Context: Apply mechanical edits without rewriting: standardize “LM” usage, enforce “wargames” spelling, remove PRISMA mentions, anonymize author block, fix em dashes, and clean duplicate image call.

Action: 
- In `main.typ`: changed title to use “Wargames”; replaced author list with a single generic anonymous author; replaced LLM/LLMs with LM/LMs across prose and headers; removed “PRISMA‑style” caption label and PRISMA mention in Methods; removed duplicate `image("creativity_quadrants.png")` call; replaced several em dashes in prose with commas; left table placeholder dashes unchanged; updated one caption to remove forward-looking note; retained search query token "LLM" pending guidance.
- In `MEMORY.md`: updated terminology to prefer LM; changed pending tasks to “screening counts” (removed PRISMA); added edit notes.
- In `METHODOLOGY_PLAN.md`: replaced LLM with LM; removed PRISMA references throughout (switched to Kitchenham SLR and screening counts); added edit notes.

Result: Manuscript and planning docs align with LM terminology, wargames spelling, and anonymized author block. All PRISMA references removed from docs; search query still contains "LLM" to preserve recall until confirmed. No structural rewrites performed.
