-At the time of writing, key SMEs associated with multiple national military organizations are actively exploring how they can use AI to provide experiential learning and potentially establish a strategic advantage through superior decision-making and judgment @black_mastering_2024. We have observed how both military SMEs and academic researchers are currently investigating how LMs can be used to help AI act as players and adjudicators in open-ended wargames. This news comes at a time when the safety-critical nature of these systems is of high importance and is receiving considerable attention. However, there is not currently a resource to help bridge the understanding gap between AI researchers and SMEs for this domain. We believe that non-military scientists and academics have a major role to play in the effectiveness and alignment of AI systems, particularly those in safety-critical settings. \

-Effective formats combine structured turns (brief → move → challenge → adjudication) with qualitative evidence requirements: claims must cite assumptions, external signals, or benchmarks. Adjudication blends simple quantitative checks (unit economics, capacity) with narrative plausibility. LMs can draft memos, scenario briefs, or stakeholder analyses conditioned on constraints (budget, brand voice, compliance) and can help enumerate second‑order effects, but human facilitators keep realism and ethics in scope.

-Language models draw on in-context information and pretraining data to simulate a target distribution of text. These characters can be recursive; if, for instance, the model context instructs it to play a solider in a wargame, it will seek not to simulate the solider but instead a wargame's portrayal of a solider, drawing on text data from fictional portrayals and stylized military communications. Because instruction-tuned models are trained to adopt a helpful assistant persona (e.g., Claude, Qwen), it may in fact simulate an assistant portraying a wargamer who is in turn portraying a solider. Each level of simulation may produce unique and unexpected artifacts from that context's conventions. For this reason, interpreting LM outputs must acknowledge the context of these recursive personas, each of which is brittle to subtle prompting and contextual changes @lutz_prompt_2025. Wargame practitioners using LMs should therefore ensure their results are replicable over diverse prompt formats, context structures, and wording changes. This LM-as-simulator framing implies that wargames using LM outputs for domain-specific tasks require human SME oversight. Sophisticated-seeming responses may not reflect domain expertise, creating overconfidence in out-of-distribution scenarios where the model's training data provides poor guidance @taubenfeld_systematic_2024.
