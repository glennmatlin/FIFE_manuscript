== Military and National Security
// [battlefield/material focused wargames vs diplomacy we can leave diplomatic aspects of military wargames to next section to avoid overlap, can mention] - isaac
At the time of writing, numerous national military and security organizations are actively exploring how they can use AI to provide experiential learning and potentially establish a strategic advantage through superior decision-making and judgment @black_scaling_2024. We have observed how both military SMEs and academic researchers are currently investigating how LMs can be used to help AI act as players and adjudicators in open-ended wargames @black_mastering_2024 @griffin_matrix_2024. This news comes at a time when the safety-critical nature of these systems is of high importance and is receiving considerable attention. However, there is not currently a resource to help bridge the understanding gap between AI researchers and SMEs for this domain. We believe that non-military scientists and academics have a major role to play in the effectiveness and alignment of AI systems, particularly those in safety-critical settings. 


Because wargames offer humans a simplified mental model that allows them to abstract away particulars and navigate decision-making and analyze the results @us_naval_war_college_fundamentals_1966 @us_army_war_college_strategic_2015, they have been used in education and training, particularly in military contexts @us_naval_war_college_war_2015 @deutschland_bundeswehr_wargaming_2017 @uk_ministry_of_defense_wargaming_2017 @uk_ministry_of_defense_wargaming_2017 @croatian_military_academy_introduction_2019 @australian_armed_forces_wargaming_2022 @polish_armed_forces_wargaming_2022 @us_army_how_2023 @nato_wargaming_2023 @french_ministry_of_the_armed_forces_wargaming_2024

== International Relations
International Relations (IR) wargaming centers on language, signaling, and credibility rather than material force, and is used for communication, negotiation, and diplomacy. Open‑ended, argument‑driven formats (seminar, matrix) capture how positions evolve through persuasion, norm invocation, and threat–promise exchanges across multiple stakeholders (e.g., national states, non-government or industrial organizations) @mans_training_2010 @schechter_wargaming_2021 @lin-greenberg_wargaming_2022. When LMs participate, their value is in maintaining coherent narratives over long horizons, proposing plausible options under contested facts, helping surface implicit assumptions in briefs and communiqués, processing scenarios, and aiding with adjudication on non-analytical rubrics and procedures.
In a similar manner to how wargames are used extensively by the officer corps of a military, wargames are commonplace among IR professionals. Wargames present an opportunity for experiential learning for diplomatic training. Wargames are used both to support training and development, and to analyze and gain a deeper understanding of diplomatic crises that were previously unseen or extremely infrequent (i.e., nuclear crises). @hersman_under_2020 @lin-greenberg_wargaming_2022 @reddie_evidence_2023 @worman_designing_2023

Compared with military applications, diplomatic games emphasize incomplete and asymmetric information, face‑saving, issue linkage (security tied to trade, technology, or climate), and a shift away from material forces towards abstracted interests. Facilitation and adjudication must account for audience costs, domestic politics, and path dependence across rounds. LMs can assist by drafting position papers, back‑channel messages, or press releases in different registers, while humans retain control of red lines, escalation ladders, and legitimacy constraints.
Practical design choices that matter include: clear turn structure (front‑channel vs. back‑channel), explicit rules for information sharing and leaks, and rubrics that reward consistency and coalition‑building rather than only “wins.” Artifact capture (transcripts, proposals, dissent notes) is crucial for after‑action learning. Reproducibility improves when scenarios, prompts, and adjudication criteria are shared alongside model/version information.
IR professionals in particular benefit from wargaming because of its creative and non-analytical structure. With subjective rubrics and emphasis on cooperation and social interactions, innovative players and adjudications are nearly necessary and alleviate human cost from traditional executions of diplomatic wargames with human players and computers, whether it is through fully autonomous or human-aided.
