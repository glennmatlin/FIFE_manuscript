# From Tabletop to Digital Twin: A Review of Biosecurity Wargaming and the Transformative Potential of Language Models

***Executive Summary:*** *Over the past quarter-century, a series of high-stakes medical and biosecurity wargames have been conducted to test the preparedness of nations and the international community against the threat of pandemics and biological attacks. From the stark bioterrorism scenarios of the early 2000s to the more recent simulations of novel respiratory viruses, these exercises have served as critical, if often unheeded, diagnostic tools. A review of these foundational simulations reveals a consistent and troubling pattern of findings: persistent vulnerabilities in resource availability, systemic failures in inter-agency and international coordination, and profound challenges in public communication and trust. Despite the evolution of scenario design, the core lessons learned have remained remarkably consistent, highlighting systemic gaps that were tragically exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.*

*As the world grapples with the lessons of that crisis, a technological revolution is underway that promises to fundamentally reshape the landscape of preparedness simulation. The advent of powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LMs), is creating a paradigm shift in wargaming. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of this transformation. Part I offers a definitive historical summary of major biosecurity wargames from Operation TOPOFF and Dark Winter to Clade X and Event 201, synthesizing their objectives, scenarios, and key findings. It demonstrates how these exercises identified the "original sins" of preparedness—resource scarcity, jurisdictional ambiguity, and the conflict between national interest and global cooperation—that continue to plague response efforts.*

*Part II presents a forward-looking literature review on the integration of LMs into these strategic exercises. It explores the core applications of this new technology, including the development of generative agent-based models that simulate realistic human behavior, the automation of scenario generation and adjudication, and the creation of AI-driven "synthetic players" to emulate human decision-makers. These advancements offer a transformative triad of capabilities—enhancing the speed, scale, and realism of simulations. This section also examines the advanced frontiers of LM application, such as automated red teaming of biosecurity protocols and the creation of integrated epidemic intelligence platforms. Finally, the report addresses the significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges that must be overcome, including model bias, the risk of "hallucination," and the critical need for explainability to ensure trust and adoption by human leaders.*

*The report concludes by connecting the persistent gaps revealed by two decades of traditional wargaming with the paradigm-shifting potential of LM-driven simulations to address these systemic challenges. It offers strategic recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and technologists to harness this new frontier of simulation science, arguing that the transition from static tabletop exercises to dynamic, AI-powered "digital twins" is essential for building a more resilient and prepared global community.*

## Part I: A Quarter-Century of Pandemic and Biosecurity Wargaming: Scenarios, Lessons, and Unheeded Warnings

### 1.1 Introduction: The Strategic Imperative of Preparedness Simulation

The practice of wargaming, with its origins rooted in 19th-century military strategy, has evolved into an indispensable tool for strategic planning across a wide range of domains. Its core value lies in creating a "safe-to-fail" environment where leaders and organizations can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. This concept has been adopted by the corporate world to navigate market uncertainty and has proven particularly vital in the fields of public health, epidemiology, and biosecurity. In these contexts, where strategic choices can have life-or-death implications, wargames provide a structured yet intellectually liberating space to test policies, anticipate the actions of other stakeholders, and uncover systemic weaknesses that are often invisible in theoretical planning documents.

The threat landscape that these simulations are designed to address has undergone a significant transformation over the past 25 years. In the immediate aftermath of the Cold War and the 9/11 attacks, the primary focus of biosecurity wargaming was on deliberate, state-sponsored or terrorist-led biological attacks using known agents like smallpox and anthrax. However, the increasing frequency of naturally emerging infectious diseases, from SARS and MERS to H1N1 and Ebola, has shifted the strategic calculus. This, combined with rapid advances in biotechnology that make the creation of engineered pathogens more accessible, has broadened the spectrum of plausible threats. The evolution of wargaming scenarios—from the covert smallpox attack of *Dark Winter* to the novel engineered parainfluenza of *Clade X* and the zoonotic coronavirus of *Event 201*—directly reflects this expanding and increasingly complex threat environment. These exercises serve as a critical historical record of our evolving understanding of biological risks and a persistent, often frustrating, chronicle of our attempts to prepare for them.

### 1.2 Foundational Exercises in Bioterrorism Response (2000-2005)

The turn of the millennium marked a pivotal period for biosecurity preparedness, driven by a growing awareness of the potential for biological weapons to be used by state or non-state actors. A series of seminal exercises conducted between 2000 and 2005 laid the groundwork for modern biodefense planning, defining the initial problem-space and revealing foundational vulnerabilities in the U.S. and international response systems.

#### 1.2.1 Operation TOPOFF (2000): The First Large-Scale Test
Congressionally mandated and co-sponsored by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), *Operation TOPOFF 2000* was the largest and most comprehensive peacetime terrorism response exercise ever conducted in the United States at the time. Its name, an abbreviation for "Top Officials," signified its intent to engage senior leaders in assessing the nation's capacity for crisis and consequence management in the face of geographically dispersed terrorist attacks. The multi-site scenario involved a simulated terrorist-motivated release of a biological agent, pneumonic plague (*Yersinia pestis*), in the Denver metropolitan area, which unfolded concurrently with a chemical weapon event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and a radiological event in the Washington, D.C. area.

*TOPOFF* was designed as a "no-notice" drill to test the readiness of local, state, and federal agencies with as much realism as possible. The exercise provided the most comprehensive effort to date to test the medical and public health infrastructure that would be called upon in a bioterrorist event. Its findings were immediate and sobering. The simulation illuminated a host of problematic issues that would become recurring themes in the years to come: deep-seated challenges in leadership and decision-making, particularly in a multi-jurisdictional crisis; the immense difficulty of prioritizing and distributing scarce medical resources; the certainty that a contagious epidemic would rapidly overwhelm healthcare facilities; and the critical, unmet need to formulate and enforce sound principles of disease containment. By stress-testing the entire response chain, from local first responders to top federal officials, *TOPOFF* provided the first concrete, large-scale evidence of the profound gaps between preparedness plans on paper and the chaotic reality of a biological crisis.

#### 1.2.2 Dark Winter (June 2001): The Wake-Up Call
Conducted just three months before the September 11th attacks and the subsequent anthrax mailings, the *Dark Winter* exercise proved to be extraordinarily prescient. Hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, among others, this senior-level tabletop exercise simulated a covert smallpox attack on the United States. The scenario unfolded over 14 simulated days, with former high-ranking government officials playing the roles of National Security Council (NSC) members, lending a high degree of verisimilitude to the policy debates. The simulation was intentionally designed to be an "unwinnable scenario" in order to push the system to its breaking point and reveal its most critical failures.

The findings from *Dark Winter* were stark and alarming. The exercise demonstrated unequivocally that a biological attack could threaten vital U.S. national security interests, leading not only to massive civilian casualties but also to a breakdown in essential institutions, widespread civil disorder, and a catastrophic loss of confidence in government. It exposed major "fault lines" between federal, state, and local governments, particularly over constitutional issues related to quarantine authority, border closures, and the federalization of the National Guard. State leaders demanded control over local public health measures, while federal officials argued for a unified national response. Perhaps the most tangible and shocking finding was the critical inadequacy of the national smallpox vaccine supply. With a 30% case-fatality rate and no effective treatment, the vaccine was the only viable medical countermeasure, yet the U.S. possessed only 7 to 12 million doses, with a production timeline of at least 24-36 months to create more. This scarcity drove much of the simulated political conflict and public panic. The impact of *Dark Winter* was profound; its videotapes were briefed to Vice President Dick Cheney shortly after 9/11, and its lessons directly informed the significant increase in biodefense funding and policy development in the Bush administration.

#### 1.2.3 Global Mercury (September 2003): Testing International Communication
Recognizing that a biological threat would not respect national borders, the Global Health Security Action Group—a coalition of health ministers from the G7 nations and Mexico—organized the *Global Mercury* tabletop exercise in 2003. The exercise simulated a smallpox bioterrorism attack affecting multiple member countries simultaneously. Its primary objective was not to test medical response capabilities within each nation, but rather to specifically evaluate the existing communication protocols between them. Coordinated by Health Canada, the exercise involved the U.S. Department of State and Department of Health and Human Services, alongside their counterparts in the seven other participating nations, simulating their respective roles in managing the foreign policy and health dimensions of an international outbreak.

*Global Mercury* represented an important early acknowledgment of the inherently international nature of biosecurity. It underscored the understanding that in a globalized world, effective response depends as much on robust diplomatic and technical communication channels as it does on domestic stockpiles and public health infrastructure.

#### 1.2.4 Atlantic Storm (January 2005): Testing the Transatlantic Alliance
Building on the international focus of *Global Mercury*, the *Atlantic Storm* exercise in 2005 raised the stakes by simulating a crisis among the closest of allies. This ministerial-level tabletop exercise, convened by the Center for Biosecurity of UPMC and the Center for Transatlantic Relations of Johns Hopkins University, portrayed a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond in real-time to a covert bioterrorist attack using smallpox. The scenario involved simultaneous releases in major transportation hubs across Europe and North America, including airports and metro systems in Istanbul, Frankfurt, Warsaw, Rotterdam, New York City, and Los Angeles, ensuring a rapidly escalating international crisis.

The exercise was designed to expose the difficult tensions between domestic political pressures and the imperative for international cooperation. The simulation starkly revealed how quickly solidarity could fracture. A central conflict revolved around the sharing of scarce medical resources, particularly smallpox vaccines. Faced with outbreaks at home, the simulated leaders of nations with substantial vaccine stockpiles were deeply reluctant to share them with allied nations that had fewer resources, a dynamic of vaccine hoarding that would later play out in reality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

*Atlantic Storm* also highlighted the vast disparities in national preparedness levels and the unrealistic expectations placed on international bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO), whose limited budget and lack of enforcement authority rendered it incapable of acting as the "honest broker" for resource distribution that many participants hoped for. The exercise was a powerful illustration of how a biosecurity crisis could trigger nationalist, self-interested responses that undermine collective security, demonstrating a classic "tragedy of the commons" on a global scale.

The exercises conducted between 2000 and 2005 should not be viewed as isolated events but as a connected, unfolding narrative that collectively diagnosed the foundational, systemic weaknesses in both U.S. and global biodefense. The process began with the identification of domestic failures. Both *TOPOFF* and *Dark Winter* revealed that resource scarcity—whether of general medical supplies or specific countermeasures like vaccines—and jurisdictional confusion between federal and state authorities were primary points of failure within the U.S. system. Having identified these domestic challenges, the focus logically expanded to the international dimension. *Global Mercury* was an explicit attempt to test the communication channels needed to manage such a crisis across borders. *Atlantic Storm* then applied extreme pressure to this international system and found that the domestic problems were not only replicated but dangerously magnified on a global scale. Vaccine scarcity no longer led to internal debates over allocation but to international hoarding and a potential breakdown of long-standing alliances. These early simulations effectively mapped an entire interconnected system of failure, from the overwhelmed local hospital in *TOPOFF*, to the conflicted governor's office in *Dark Winter*, to the fraught transatlantic summit in *Atlantic Storm*. The failure to resolve these issues at their root ensured they would re-emerge as the central challenges of future crises.

### 1.3 Pivoting to Pandemic Preparedness: Simulating Novel Pathogens (2018-2019)

After a period focused heavily on known bioterror agents, a series of high-profile exercises conducted just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic marked a significant pivot. This new wave of simulations shifted focus away from smallpox and anthrax toward the more probable threat of novel, rapidly spreading respiratory pathogens, whether deliberately engineered or naturally emerging. These exercises proved to be remarkably and tragically prescient.

#### 1.3.1 Clade X (May 2018): Confronting an Engineered Biological Crisis
Hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, *Clade X* was a day-long tabletop exercise that simulated a series of National Security Council meetings responding to a severe pandemic. The scenario was distinct from its predecessors in its choice of pathogen: a novel, fictional parainfluenza virus with genetic elements of the highly lethal Nipah virus. In the scenario, the virus, dubbed "Clade X," was moderately contagious and moderately lethal, and had been intentionally engineered and released by a fringe group bent on reducing the human population.

The outcome of the simulation was catastrophic. Despite the best efforts of the senior leaders playing their real-life roles, the exercise concluded with a projection of 150 million deaths worldwide, including 15 million in the United States, within a single year. The exercise drove home a number of critical policy failures. Foremost among them was the finding that existing capabilities would require years to produce a new vaccine for a novel pathogen, while the crisis demanded a timeline of months. This gap between the speed of the virus and the speed of science was identified as the central strategic vulnerability. The exercise also highlighted the lack of a strong and sustainable global health security system, as well as a chronically underfunded and under-resourced national public health system in the U.S., which would be incapable of managing the challenges of a severe pandemic response. By moving beyond the established bioterror paradigm, *Clade X* directly confronted the more plausible threat of a novel respiratory virus and correctly identified that the timeline for medical countermeasure (MCM) development and manufacturing would be the single most critical variable in determining the outcome of such a crisis.

#### 1.3.2 Crimson Contagion (January-August 2019): A Functional Test of U.S. Response
Perhaps the most operationally predictive of the pre-COVID-19 exercises was *Crimson Contagion*. Conducted over several months in 2019, this was not a tabletop discussion but a series of large-scale functional exercises led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The simulation involved 19 federal departments and agencies, 12 states, and numerous private sector partners, testing the nation's ability to respond to a severe influenza pandemic. The scenario began with a novel avian influenza virus (H7N9) emerging in China and spreading rapidly around the world, with the first U.S. cases appearing in Chicago after being brought by infected travelers.

The draft after-action report, dated October 2019, painted a grim picture of American unreadiness. The simulation projected staggering numbers: 110 million infected Americans, 7.7 million hospitalizations, and 586,000 deaths. The exercise uncovered profound operational failures across the U.S. government. Participants found that the federal government lacked sufficient designated funding to respond to a severe pandemic, with the report noting that HHS would require in excess of $10 billion in immediate new funding to secure MCMs. There was significant confusion among federal agencies regarding statutory authorities and which entity—HHS or FEMA—would take the lead in a crisis. Most critically, the exercise revealed that the United States lacked the domestic manufacturing capacity and raw materials for almost all necessary pandemic medical countermeasures, including personal protective equipment (PPE), needles, therapeutics, and ventilators. While other exercises focused on high-level policy, *Crimson Contagion* tested the nuts and bolts of the U.S. response system and found it fundamentally broken—a near-perfect forecast of the logistical and bureaucratic struggles that would paralyze the country just months later.

#### 1.3.3 Event 201 (October 2019): A Global Coronavirus Pandemic
Held in New York City just weeks before the first cases of what would become known as COVID-19 were publicly identified in Wuhan, China, *Event 201* has become famous for its uncanny timing and choice of pathogen. Hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, this high-level tabletop exercise simulated the outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus. In the fictional scenario, the virus originated in pig farms in Brazil, jumped to humans, and eventually became efficiently transmissible from person to person, sparking a global pandemic for which no vaccine was available in the first year.

The simulation ended after 18 months with a projection of 65 million deaths worldwide, accompanied by severe economic and societal disruption. While its predecessors had focused primarily on government response, the unique and vital contribution of *Event 201* was its explicit focus on the necessity of public-private partnerships. The exercise brought together 15 leaders from global business, government, and public health to confront the cascading consequences of the pandemic. The key finding was that a severe pandemic could not be managed by governments alone. The players' discussions highlighted the need for reliable cooperation among industries, national governments, and international institutions to avoid catastrophic outcomes. The exercise's recommendations centered on this theme, calling for governments and businesses to plan in advance for how essential corporate capabilities—in logistics, supply chain management, social media, and communications—would be utilized in a crisis. It also stressed the urgent need for public and private sectors to collaborate on developing methods to combat the rampant mis- and disinformation that would inevitably accompany a pandemic. *Event 201* correctly identified that a modern pandemic is as much an economic and informational crisis as it is a public health one, requiring a whole-of-society response.

The progression of wargames from 2018 to 2019 reveals a critical evolution in strategic thinking about biological threats. The focus shifted decisively from a national security-centric model centered on bioterrorism to a more comprehensive model of global public health and economic resilience. The nature of the threat was reconceptualized, moving from an external adversary to be countered with "guns and guards" to a complex, cascading systems failure requiring the mobilization of "genes and global supply chains." Early exercises like *Dark Winter* and *Atlantic Storm* framed the problem as a "biological attack," prompting discussions about military roles and traditional security responses. *Clade X* maintained the attack framework but identified the primary solution not as a security action but a scientific one: the need for rapid MCM development, pivoting the focus toward industrial and R&D capacity. *Crimson Contagion* advanced this shift by simulating a naturally occurring influenza outbreak, and its findings were almost entirely logistical and bureaucratic, concerning funding, supply chains, and agency jurisdictions. The problem was no longer one of security, but of industrial and administrative capability. *Event 201* completed this transition by simulating a natural coronavirus and centering its discussions on the indispensable role of global business, finance, and media in both the crisis and its resolution. This intellectual journey reflects a growing understanding that a pandemic is not a conventional war to be fought with traditional tools, but a multifaceted systems crisis that demands the mobilization of economic, industrial, scientific, and informational resources on a global scale.

### 1.4 Synthesis of Key Findings: A Legacy of Unheeded Warnings

An analysis of the major biosecurity wargames conducted over the past quarter-century reveals a clear, consistent, and deeply troubling pattern of identified vulnerabilities. Despite variations in scenarios, pathogens, and participants, the core findings have remained remarkably stable, constituting a legacy of warnings that were largely unheeded prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most persistent theme is **resource scarcity**. From the critical shortage of smallpox vaccine that drove the strategic paralysis in *Dark Winter* to the lack of sufficient international stockpiles that fractured alliances in *Atlantic Storm*, the inability to rapidly produce and distribute medical countermeasures has been a central finding. This was echoed with chilling precision in *Crimson Contagion*, which highlighted the nation's lack of domestic manufacturing capacity for essential supplies like PPE and ventilators—a failure that became a defining feature of the early COVID-19 response.

A second recurring failure is in **coordination and authority**. The "major 'fault lines'" between federal, state, and local governments over quarantine and resource allocation identified in *Dark Winter* in 2001 were mirrored nearly two decades later in *Crimson Contagion's* finding of widespread confusion over lead agency roles and statutory authorities. This jurisdictional ambiguity consistently hampers effective and unified decision-making, creating seams that a rapidly spreading pathogen can exploit.

Third, the exercises consistently highlighted the immense challenge of **public communication and trust**. The need to manage public anxiety, communicate difficult decisions about resource rationing, and counter misinformation were central dilemmas in *Dark Winter*, *Atlantic Storm*, and *Event 201*. These simulations demonstrated that maintaining public confidence is a critical component of an effective response, without which public health measures are likely to fail.

Finally, the simulations repeatedly exposed the fundamental tension between **global cooperation and national interest**. The impulse for nations to hoard critical resources, such as vaccines, for their own populations, as vividly demonstrated in *Atlantic Storm*, can undermine the collective international effort required to contain a global threat. This conflict between sovereign self-interest and the public health imperative for global cooperation remains a central, unresolved dilemma in pandemic preparedness.

## Part II: The Next Generation of Preparedness: A Literature Review on the Integration of Language Models in Biosecurity Simulation

While the historical record of biosecurity wargaming reveals a frustrating consistency in identified weaknesses, the technological landscape of simulation itself is undergoing a radical transformation. The emergence of powerful artificial intelligence, and specifically generative large language models (LMs), is poised to revolutionize the design, execution, and analytical depth of these critical exercises. This section reviews the burgeoning academic and technical literature on this integration, exploring how LMs are beginning to address the long-standing limitations of traditional wargaming and opening up new frontiers for preparedness.

### 2.1 The Technological Leap: From Static Models to Dynamic, AI-Driven Environments

Traditional wargames, while invaluable for fostering discussion and revealing policy gaps, have inherent limitations in modeling the full complexity of a crisis. Even when augmented with computational models, they often struggle to represent the nuanced, irrational, and unpredictable nature of human behavior, frequently relying on pre-scripted events ("injects") or simplified assumptions about how individuals and institutions will act. Agent-based models (ABMs) have offered a significant improvement by simulating the interactions of numerous individual agents, but these agents have historically operated based on a set of rigid, pre-defined behavioral rules, limiting their ability to adapt to novel situations or exhibit complex reasoning.

The AI and LM paradigm shift offers a solution to this long-standing challenge. Unlike previous technologies, LMs are capable of understanding, reasoning about, and generating human-like text in an open-ended fashion. This allows them to move beyond the confines of purely quantitative, rule-based systems to simulate the qualitative aspects of a crisis: strategic deliberation, public communication, political negotiation, and individual decision-making under uncertainty. This technological leap enables the creation of dynamic, adaptive simulation environments that can model not just the spread of a pathogen, but the complex social, political, and informational systems through which the pandemic unfolds.

### 2.2 Core Applications of Language Models in Wargaming

The integration of LMs into wargaming is not a monolithic development but rather a suite of new capabilities that address different facets of the simulation process. The literature points to three core applications that are fundamentally changing the field: generative agent-based modeling, automated scenario design, and AI-driven role emulation.

#### 2.2.1 Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM): Simulating Realistic Human Behavior
A groundbreaking application of LMs is their use as the "brains" for individual agents within an agent-based model. The 2023 paper "Epidemic Modeling with Generative Agents" presents a new paradigm, the Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM), where agents are not programmed with fixed rules but are instead empowered by an LLM like ChatGPT to reason and make decisions. In this framework, each agent is given a unique persona—including personality traits, a biography, and a memory of recent events—and uses the LLM to decide on its actions, such as whether to self-quarantine based on its own symptoms or news of rising case counts in its community.

The results of this approach are remarkable for their realism. Without being explicitly programmed to do so, the population of generative agents demonstrated emergent behaviors that mirrored real-world pandemic responses. When given full information feedback, the agents collectively "flattened the curve" and produced multiple, successive waves of infection, driven by a dynamic feedback loop between their perception of risk and their collective behavior. This represents a significant leap from modeling epidemiology to modeling *socio-epidemiology*. It allows for the simulation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based not on crude, top-down assumptions about compliance rates, but on the emergent, bottom-up behavior of a population of psychologically plausible agents.

#### 2.2.2 Automated Scenario Generation, Adjudication, and Moderation
Another major application of LMs is in streamlining the wargame design and execution process itself. Traditionally, creating a rich, detailed scenario is a labor-intensive process that can take months, often leading designers to rely on a limited set of familiar, worst-case assumptions—a problem described as the "rigid road to war". LMs can automate and accelerate this process, rapidly generating a wide variety of plausible alternative scenarios, complete with detailed backstories, simulated news reports, and intelligence briefings.

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) has developed a capability called Generative Wargaming (GenWar) that integrates LMs with existing high-fidelity military simulations like the Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM). In this system, the LLM acts as a natural language interface, or "translator," allowing non-technical users like policymakers to set up complex scenarios using plain English commands. The LLM converts these commands into the technical inputs the simulation requires, runs the model, and then translates the adjudicated results back into a natural language summary. This drastically reduces the time and technical expertise needed to design and run a wargame, from months to days. This "democratization" of wargaming makes the tool faster, cheaper, and more accessible, enabling rapid iteration and allowing human experts to focus their limited time on analyzing the most critical and strategically interesting scenarios identified by the AI.

#### 2.2.3 AI-Driven Role Emulation: The Synthetic Player
Perhaps the most direct application of LMs is as "synthetic players" that can emulate the decision-making of human participants. This addresses one of the primary logistical and financial hurdles of high-level wargames: the difficulty and expense of assembling senior leaders and subject matter experts in one room. Several frameworks are emerging to tackle this challenge. The "Snow Globe" project provides an open-source, LLM-powered multi-agent system specifically designed for playing qualitative, text-based wargames like seminar or political games. In this system, AI player agents can be assigned specific "personas"—such as a risk-averse public health official, an aggressive military leader, or a representative from a specific country—which then guide their open-ended textual responses during the game.

Similarly, JHU/APL's Strategic AI Gaming Engine (SAGE) uses generative AI to replace human players in simulations of high-level policy discussions, such as a National Security Council meeting. These systems provide immense value as training and brainstorming tools, allowing a single human analyst to wargame a scenario on demand against a team of diverse AI personas. Furthermore, they allow for an AI to play against itself hundreds or thousands of times at machine speed, exploring a vast range of strategic possibilities and identifying recurring patterns, unexpected outcomes, and outlier strategies that human players might never consider.

These core applications of LMs in wargaming constitute a powerful and synergistic triad of transformation, simultaneously addressing three fundamental limitations of traditional methods. First, systems like GenWar attack the problem of **speed**, drastically compressing the wargame development cycle from months to days and making sophisticated modeling tools accessible through natural language. Second, synthetic player systems like SAGE and Snow Globe attack the problem of **scale**, overcoming the logistical bottleneck of scheduling human experts and enabling a massive number of iterative playthroughs that were previously impossible. Third, Generative Agent-Based Models attack the problem of **realism**, replacing the simplistic, rigid behavioral rules of traditional agents with the emergent, psychologically-grounded, and adaptive decision-making of LLM-powered agents. These capabilities are mutually reinforcing. A faster, more scalable system gains immense value when its results are more realistic. A more realistic behavioral model is most useful when it can be run quickly and at a scale sufficient to generate robust, statistically significant insights. Together, these three advancements represent not just an incremental improvement but a holistic evolution of the wargaming discipline itself.

### 2.3 Advanced Applications and Future Frontiers

Beyond these core applications, researchers are exploring even more advanced and integrated uses of LMs that could further revolutionize biosecurity preparedness, moving from offline simulation to real-time decision support.

#### 2.3.1 Automated Red Teaming of Biosecurity Protocols
Red teaming is a form of adversarial testing where a "red team" actively challenges plans, assumptions, and security systems to identify vulnerabilities. This practice, long used in cybersecurity, is now being applied to biosecurity, and LMs are poised to automate and scale this process. LMs can be tasked with acting as a malicious adversary, probing for weaknesses in AI-driven biosecurity systems or even in scientific protocols themselves. For example, research has shown that LMs trained in biochemistry can be manipulated to generate pathways for dangerous toxins, and models designed for drug discovery can be repurposed to create novel biological threats.

Frameworks like AutoRedTeamer are being developed to create a fully automated, end-to-end red teaming pipeline. Such a system can continuously generate novel attack vectors—such as creating deceptive genomic data to fool a pathogen surveillance system or designing "jailbreak" prompts to bypass safety filters on DNA synthesis screening software—and use them to stress-test defenses. This creates the potential for a dynamic, continuous security evaluation process, moving beyond periodic, human-led exercises to a state where an AI red team is constantly probing for weaknesses, allowing our biosecurity defenses to adapt and evolve in near-real-time.

#### 2.3.2 LM-Powered Virtual Simulated Patients (VSPs)
In the realm of medical education and training, LMs are being integrated into Virtual Simulated Patient (VSP) platforms to create highly realistic and interactive learning tools. Traditional VSPs often rely on branched-logic dialogues, offering a limited set of pre-scripted conversational paths. LM-powered VSPs, by contrast, can engage in open-ended, natural language conversations, allowing medical students and professionals to practice their clinical reasoning, diagnostic, and patient communication skills in a more authentic manner. Research has shown that these advanced VSPs, sometimes combined with social robotic platforms for physical presence, are perceived by students as more authentic and providing a more beneficial learning experience than conventional computer-based platforms. This technology offers a way to scale high-fidelity medical training, providing a consistent, adaptable, and endlessly repeatable learning environment that can augment and enhance traditional medical education.

#### 2.3.3 Integrated Epidemic Intelligence Platforms
The ultimate vision for this technology is the creation of comprehensive, AI-driven epidemic intelligence platforms that fuse real-time surveillance, predictive modeling, and decision support. Such systems would leverage the Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities of LMs to ingest and analyze vast, unstructured, and multilingual data streams—from social media posts and news reports to electronic health records—to detect and characterize disease outbreaks far earlier than traditional methods.

Advanced models like PandemicLLM, currently in development, aim to move beyond simple numerical prediction toward a more sophisticated, reasoning-based forecasting. By integrating diverse and complex real-time variables, such as shifts in public policy, viral evolution, and population behavior, these systems can generate more accurate and robust predictions of an outbreak's trajectory. The goal is to create a true "digital twin" of the public health environment—a dynamic simulation that continuously updates with real-world data. This would provide public health officials with a powerful tool for real-time decision support, helping them to more effectively allocate scarce resources, proactively counter misinformation, and anticipate the impact of interventions with unprecedented speed and precision.

### 2.4 Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Frameworks

Despite their transformative potential, the integration of LMs into high-stakes domains like biosecurity wargaming is fraught with significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges that must be addressed to ensure their responsible and effective use.

#### 2.4.1 Technical Hurdles: Bias, Hallucination, and Unpredictability
LMs are not objective reasoning engines; they are complex statistical models trained on vast swaths of human-generated text from the internet. As a result, they can inherit and amplify the biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that may be skewed along racial, gender, or cultural lines. They are also prone to "hallucination"—generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information that is presented with a confident and plausible-sounding tone. Furthermore, their behavior can be unpredictable. Studies comparing the performance of LLM agents to human experts in crisis wargames have found that the LLMs can exhibit more aggressive and escalatory tendencies. In the context of a biosecurity simulation, an LLM agent that hallucinates a key scientific fact about a pathogen's transmissibility or adopts an irrationally aggressive policy stance could not only invalidate the exercise but could also lead decision-makers to draw dangerously flawed conclusions.

#### 2.4.2 Ethical Imperatives: Fairness, Privacy, and Accountability
The use of AI in public health simulations raises profound ethical questions that extend beyond technical performance. An ethical framework for AI in healthcare must address the risk of biased algorithms and promote fairness in outcomes, mandating regular audits and corrective measures when disparities are identified. Training these models often requires vast amounts of data, including potentially sensitive health and behavioral information, creating significant privacy concerns that must be managed in accordance with regulations and public trust. Perhaps most challenging is the question of accountability. If an AI-driven simulation informs a policy decision that ultimately causes harm, who is responsible? The developers who built the model? The officials who relied on its output? The algorithm itself? The absence of a clear and robust ethical framework for governance and accountability remains a major barrier to the responsible deployment of these powerful technologies in high-stakes public health decision-making.

#### 2.4.3 The "Black Box" Problem: The Need for Explainability
Many of the most powerful AI and LM systems operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal decision-making processes are opaque even to their creators. While a model may produce a highly accurate prediction or a compelling strategic recommendation, it often cannot articulate *why* it reached that conclusion in a way that is intelligible to a human user. This lack of explainability is a critical obstacle to adoption. A senior policymaker or public health official cannot be expected to trust a recommendation from an AI—to implement a lockdown, to prioritize a certain demographic for vaccination, to close a border—without a clear, logical, and verifiable explanation of the reasoning and evidence behind it. Therefore, developing "Explainable AI" (XAI) is not merely a desirable technical feature; it is a fundamental prerequisite for building the trust necessary for human decision-makers to confidently and responsibly use these tools as strategic advisors in a crisis.

The integration of LMs into wargaming presents designers with a fundamental dilemma, forcing a trade-off between the control inherent in traditional methods and the potential for greater realism offered by AI. A conventional wargame is, in essence, a controlled experiment. The designers define the rules, control the inputs, and can trace any outcome back to a specific player action or pre-scripted event. The value lies in observing human reactions within this carefully circumscribed system. An LM-driven wargame, in contrast, is more akin to an uncontrolled sociological experiment. The behaviors of the AI agents are emergent, arising from the complex interplay of their training data, their assigned personas, and the evolving context of the game. Their "reasoning" may be opaque and their actions unpredictable. This means the simulation's output is no longer just a reflection of human choices within a known system, but a product of the complex interaction between humans and an AI whose behavior may not be fully understood. Consequently, the primary challenge for the wargamer shifts from simply *observing* the game to actively *validating* it. A much higher burden is placed on post-game analysis and interpretation to answer a critical question: is the emergent behavior observed a realistic simulation of human response, or is it merely an artifact of the LLM's intrinsic biases and the peculiarities of its training data?

## 3. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations

The history of biosecurity wargaming over the last quarter-century is a story of remarkable foresight and frustrating inertia. Time and again, from *Dark Winter* to *Crimson Contagion*, these simulations accurately identified the core vulnerabilities that would cripple the initial global response to COVID-19: chronic shortages of essential medical supplies, paralyzing jurisdictional conflicts, the corrosive effects of misinformation, and the tension between nationalistic impulses and the need for global solidarity. The warnings were clear, consistent, and largely unheeded.

Now, at the intersection of this hard-won historical experience and a technological revolution in artificial intelligence, there is an opportunity to break this cycle. The persistent gaps in preparedness—failures in coordination, communication, and logistics, all driven by the complex and often unpredictable dynamics of human behavior—are precisely the kinds of problems that LM-driven simulations are uniquely suited to explore. This new generation of wargaming offers a path to move beyond simply re-identifying these well-known problems and toward simulating, testing, and refining dynamic, adaptive solutions in a more realistic, scalable, and accessible way. By embracing this technology responsibly, we can transform wargaming from a diagnostic tool that tells us what we already should know into a truly generative tool that helps us discover what we need to do.

To seize this opportunity, a concerted effort is required from policymakers, researchers, and technologists.

**Recommendations for Policy, Research, and Development:**

**For Policymakers:**
* **Establish a National Initiative for Next-Generation Preparedness Simulation:** A national-level, multi-agency initiative should be created to fund, coordinate, and standardize the development and validation of advanced, LM-driven simulation platforms for pandemic and biosecurity preparedness. This would ensure that insights and tools are shared across government and are built to common standards of rigor and reliability.
* **Develop a Robust Governance and Ethics Framework:** A cross-agency task force, including representatives from HHS, DoD, DHS, and the intelligence community, along with external experts in ethics and law, should be convened to establish a clear ethical and governance framework for the use of AI in public health wargaming. This framework must explicitly address issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, transparency, and accountability to ensure these powerful tools are used responsibly.

**For Researchers:**
* **Prioritize Interdisciplinary Validation Studies:** Research funding should be directed toward interdisciplinary projects that combine epidemiology, computer science, and the social sciences. The primary goal of this research should be to rigorously validate the behavior of LM-powered agents against real-world human response data from past pandemics and public health crises, building a strong empirical foundation for their use.
* **Focus on Explainable AI (XAI) for Crisis Decision-Making:** The academic and research communities must prioritize the development of XAI methods tailored specifically to the needs of strategic decision-makers. The goal should be to move beyond opaque "black box" models to systems that can provide clear, intuitive, and verifiable explanations for their recommendations, which is essential for building trust and facilitating adoption.

**For Technologists and Wargame Designers:**
* **Develop Standardized and Replicable Platforms:** In response to critiques of current wargaming practices, developers should work toward creating standardized platforms and protocols for LM-driven simulations. This includes transparent documentation of models, prompts, and data sources to ensure that results are replicable and comparable across different studies and organizations.
* **Invest in and Integrate Automated Red Teaming:** The development of automated red teaming capabilities should be a high priority. These tools should be integrated into the development lifecycle of both AI systems and biosecurity protocols, creating a culture of continuous, adversarial stress-testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
