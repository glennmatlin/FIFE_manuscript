 strategic planning, managing uncertainty, and the role of facilitation and judgment in
 producing insights rather than score-keeping. This long
 tradition is our motivation to focus on language‑based or open-ended wargames.\

 Practical design choices that matter include: clear turn structure (front‑channel vs. back‑channel), explicit rules for information sharing and leaks, and rubrics that reward consistency and coalition‑building rather than only “wins.” Artifact capture (transcripts, proposals, dissent notes) is crucial for after‑action learning. Reproducibility improves when scenarios, prompts, and adjudication criteria are shared alongside model/version information.\
-IR professionals in particular benefit from wargaming because of its creative and non-analytical structure. With subjective rubrics and emphasis on cooperation and social interactions, innovative players and adjudications are nearly necessary and alleviate human cost from traditional executions of diplomatic wargames with human players and computers, whether it is through fully autonomous or human-aided.

+adjudication rubrics with seeds and model versions @downes_martin_wargaming_2025. Expand beyond short horizons by testing
 memory, retrieval, and role‑stability over multi‑turn scenarios. Compare lightweight
 interventions (system prompts, few‑shot ICL, adapters) with simple baselines. Encourage
 artifact release (transcripts, code, minimal configs) to enable replication across venues.
