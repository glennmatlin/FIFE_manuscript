#abstract[
Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed for use in defense and security settings to provide humans with insights for real-world decision-making. One prominent example is the use of LMs to play, adjudicate, and analyze strategic wargames. LMs are particularly useful for contexts with open-ended dynamic problems when gameplay is non-linear and entirely novel solutions can be proposed.
// GLENN: need a hook here that pulls people in using a safety argument of some kind... make it critical and important! danger danger!! get people interested.
This new generation of _Artificial Intelligence (AI) wargames_ relies more on *creative* problem-solving and reasoning over *analytical* rigor and precision. However, there have been significant hurdles for AI researchers when publishing in this field due to the domain-specific and knowledge-intensive requirements of professional wargaming. We present a scoping literature review of #num_papers recent works on AI wargames and present a novel ontology for researchers to engage with AI wargaming. We provide a discussion for researchers on how to use our ontology to appropriately categorize their own game environment and discover new literature ...(TODO)... This paper provides a consolidated look at this emerging area ...(TODO)... and provides clear direction for other researchers to pursue. Our goal is to encourage responsible experimentation with LMs in wargaming and adjacent, languageâ€‘centric simulations.]
